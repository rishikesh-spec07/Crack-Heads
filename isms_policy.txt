================================================================================
1.0 Purpose and Benefits
Appropriate organizational use of information and information technology (“IT”) resources and effective security of those resources require the participation and support of the organization’s workforce (“users”).  Inappropriate use exposes the organization to potential risks including virus attacks, compromise of network systems and services, and legal issues.
2.0 Authority
[Organization Information]
3.0 Scope
This policy applies to users of any system’s information or physical infrastructure regardless of its form or format, created or used to support the organization. It is the user’s responsibility to read and understand this policy and to conduct their activities in accordance with its terms. In addition, users must read and understand the organization’s Information Security Policy and its associated standards.
4.0 Information Statement
Except for any privilege or confidentiality recognized by law, individuals have no legitimate expectation of privacy during any use of the organziation’s IT resources or in any data on those resources.  Any use may be monitored, intercepted, recorded, read, copied, accessed or captured in any manner including in real time, and used or disclosed in any manner, by authorized personnel without additional prior notice to individuals. Periodic monitoring will be conducted of systems used, including but not limited to:  all computer files; and all forms of electronic communication (including email, text messaging, instant messaging, telephones, computer systems and other electronic records). In addition to the notice provided in this policy, users may also be notified with a warning banner text at system entry points where users initially sign on about being monitored and may be reminded that unauthorized use of the organization’s IT resources is not permissible.
The organization may impose restrictions, at the discretion of their executive management, on the use of a particular IT resource.  For example, the organization may block access to certain websites or services not serving legitimate business purposes or may restrict user ability to attach devices to the organization’s IT resources (e.g., personal USB drives, iPods).
Users accessing the organization’s applications and IT resources through personal devices must only do so with prior approval or authorization from the organization.
Acceptable Use
All uses of information and information technology resources must comply with organizational policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines, as well as any applicable license agreements and laws including Federal, State, local and intellectual property laws.
Consistent with the foregoing, the acceptable use of information and IT resources encompasses the following duties:
Understanding the baseline information security controls necessary to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information;
Protecting organizational information and resources from unauthorized use or disclosure;
Protecting personal, private, sensitive, or confidential information from unauthorized use or disclosure;
Observing authorized levels of access and utilizing only approved IT technology devices or services; and
Immediately reporting suspected information security incidents or weaknesses to the appropriate manager and the Information Security Officer (ISO)/designated security representative.
4.1	Unacceptable Use
The following list is not intended to be exhaustive, but is an attempt to provide a framework for activities that constitute unacceptable use. Users, however, may be exempted from one or more of these restrictions during their authorized job responsibilities, after approval from organizational management, in consultation with organization IT staff (e.g., storage of objectionable material in the context of a disciplinary matter).
Unacceptable use includes, but is not limited to, the following:
Unauthorized use or disclosure of personal, private, sensitive, and/or confidential information;
Unauthorized use or disclosure of organization information and resources;
Distributing, transmitting, posting, or storing any electronic communications, material or correspondence that is threatening, obscene, harassing, pornographic, offensive, defamatory, discriminatory, inflammatory, illegal, or intentionally false or inaccurate;
Attempting to represent the organization in matters unrelated to official authorized job duties or responsibilities;
Connecting unapproved devices to the organization’s network or any IT resource;
Connecting organizational IT resources to unauthorized networks;
Connecting to any wireless network while physically connected to the organization’s wired network;
Installing, downloading, or running software that has not been approved following appropriate security, legal, and/or IT review in accordance with organizational policies;
Connecting to commercial email systems (e.g., Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo) without prior management approval (organizations must recognize the inherent risk in using commercial email services as email is often used to distribute malware);
Using an organization’s IT resources to circulate unauthorized solicitations or advertisements for non-organizational purposes including religious, political, or not-for-profit entities;
Providing unauthorized third parties, including family and friends, access to the organization’s IT information, resources or facilities;
Using orgnanization IT information or resources for commercial or personal purposes, in support of "for-profit" activities or in support of other outside employment or business activity (e.g., consulting for pay, business transactions);
Propagating chain letters, fraudulent mass mailings, spam, or other types of undesirable and unwanted email content using organizational IT resources; and
Tampering, disengaging, or otherwise circumventing an organization or third-party IT security controls.
4.2	Occasional and Incidental Personal Use
Occasional, incidental and necessary personal use of IT resources is permitted, provided such use: is otherwise consistent with this policy; is limited in amount and duration; and does not impede the ability of the individual or other users to fulfill the organization’s responsibilities and duties, including but not limited to, extensive bandwidth, resource, or storage utilization. Exercising good judgment regarding occasional and incidental personal use is important.  Organizations may revoke or limit this privilege at any time.
4.3	Individual Accountability
Individual accountability is required when accessing all IT resources and organization information.  Everyone is responsible for protecting against unauthorized activities performed under their user ID.  This includes locking your computer screen when you walk away from your system, and protecting your credentials (e.g., passwords, tokens or similar technology) from unauthorized disclosure.  Credentials must be treated as confidential information, and must not be disclosed or shared.
4.4	Restrictions on Off-Site Transmission and Storage of Information
Users must not transmit restricted organization, non-public, personal, private, sensitive, or confidential information to or from personal email accounts (e.g., Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo) or use a personal email account to conduct the organization’s business unless explicitly authorized. Users must not store restricted organizational, non-public, personal, private, sensitive, or confidential information on a non-organizational issued device, or with a third-party file storage service that has not been approved for such storage by the organization.
Devices that contain organizational information must be attended at all times or physically secured and must not be checked in transportation carrier luggage systems.
4.5	User Responsibility for IT Equipment
Users are routinely assigned or given access to IT equipment in connection with their official duties.  This equipment belongs to the organization and must be immediately returned upon request or at the time an employee is separated from the organization.  Users may be financially responsible for the value of equipment assigned to their care if it is not returned to the organization.  Should IT equipment be lost, stolen or destroyed, users are required to provide a written report of the circumstances surrounding the incident.  Users may be subject to disciplinary action which may include repayment of the replacement value of the equipment. The organization has the discretion to not issue or re-issue IT devices and equipment to users who repeatedly lose or damage IT equipment.
4.6	Use of Social Media
The use of public social media sites to promote organizational activities requires written pre-approval from the Public Information Office (PIO).  Approval is at the discretion of the PIO and may be granted upon demonstration of a business need, and a review and approval of service agreement terms by organization’s Counsel’s Office. Final approval by the PIO should define the scope of the approved activity, including, but not limited to, identifying approved users.
Unless specifically authorized, the use of organizational email addresses on public social media sites is prohibited. In instances where users access social media sites on their own time utilizing personal resources, they must remain sensitive to expectations that they will conduct themselves in a responsible, professional, and secure manner with regard to references to the organization and staff. These expectations are outlined below.
Use of Social Media within the Scope of Official Duties
The PIO, or designee, must review and approve the content of any posting of public information, such as blog comments, tweets, video files, or streams, to social media sites on behalf of the organization. However, PIO approval is not required for postings to public forums for technical support, if participation in such forums is within the scope of the user’s official duties, has been previously approved by his or her supervisor, and does not include the posting of any sensitive information, including specifics of the IT infrastructure. In addition, PIO approval is not required for postings to private, organization approved social media collaboration sites (e.g., Yammer).  Blanket approvals may be granted, as appropriate.
Accounts used to manage the organization’s social media presence are privileged accounts and must be treated as such. These accounts are for official use only and must not be used for personal use. Passwords of privileged accounts must follow information security standards, be unique on each site, and must not be the same as passwords used to access other IT resources.
Guidelines for Personal Use of Social Media
Staff should be sensitive to the fact that information posted on social media sites clearly reflects on the individual and may also reflect on the individual’s professional life. Consequently, staff should use discretion when posting information on these sites and be conscious of the potential perceptions of and responses to the information. It is important to remember that once information is posted on a social media site, it can be captured and used in ways not originally intended. It is nearly impossible to retract, as it often lives on in copies, archives, backups, and memory cache.
Users should respect the privacy of the organization’s staff and not post any identifying information of any staff without permission (including, but not limited to, names, addresses, photos, videos, email addresses, and phone numbers). Users may be held liable for comments posted on social media sites.
If a personal email, posting, or other electronic message could be construed to be an official communication, a disclaimer is strongly recommended. A disclaimer might be: “The views and opinions expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of the organization.”
Users should not use their personal social media accounts for official business, unless specifically authorized by the organization. Users are strongly discouraged from using the same passwords in their personal use of social media sites as those used on organiztional devices and IT resources, to prevent unauthorized access to resources if the password is compromised.

FILE: Account-Management-Access-Control-Standard.docx
================================================================================
1.0 Purpose and Benefits
The purpose of this standard is to establish the rules and processes for creating, maintaining and controlling the access of a digital identity to an entity’s applications and resources for means of protecting their systems and information.
2.0 Authority
[Organization information]
3.0 Scope
This standard covers all systems developed by, or on behalf of the entity, that require authenticated access. This includes all development, test, quality assurance, production and other ad hoc systems.
4.0 Information Statement
Account management and access control includes the process of requesting, creating, issuing, modifying and disabling user accounts; enabling and disabling access to resources and applications; establishing conditions for group and role membership; tracking accounts and their respective access authorizations; and managing these functions.
Account Management/Access Control Roles
Account management and access control require that the roles of Information Owner, Account Manager and, optionally, Account Administrator and Entitlement Administrator, are defined and assigned for each resource and application.  A listing of authorized users in these roles must be documented and maintained.  The associated tasks and responsibilities for each role are described below.  Each role may belong to one or more individuals depending on the application.  In some cases, a single individual or group may be assigned more than one of these roles.
Information Owner:  Information owners are people at the managerial level within an entity who:
Delegate account managers to ensure the appropriate level of information access is provided.  Delegation can be to individual users, groups and/or third parties (e.g., another entity).
Define roles and groups, as well as the corresponding level of access to resources for that role or group.
Determining who should have access.
Determine the identity assurance level for the application and/or data.
Review that accounts and access controls are commensurate with overall business function and that the associated rights have been properly assigned, at a minimum, annually.
Require business units with access to protected resources to notify account managers when accounts are no longer required, such as when users are terminated or transferred and when individual access requirements change.
Account Manager:  Account managers maintain accounts.  They are the delegated custodians of protected data.  Account managers:
Maintain appropriate levels of communication with the information owners to determine the level or degree of access granted to an individual.
Determine the technical specifications needed to set access privileges.
Delegate account management functions to account administrators.
Create and maintain procedures used in managing accounts.
Perform all account administrator duties as required.
Account Administrators:  Account administrators are an optional subset of the account manager role.  They do not determine procedures. System rights and/or responsibilities are assigned to them by the account manager.  All account administrator responsibilities are contained within the role of account manager should an account administrator not exist.  A subset of account administrator duties may be assigned as appropriate. For example, a role for password reset only may exist for service desk employees. Additionally, some of these responsibilities may remain with the account manager should that manager determine it is necessary.  For account management, the administrator may:
Maintain any necessary information supporting account administration activities, including account management requests and approvals.
Enroll new users.
Enable/disable user accounts.
Create and maintain user roles and groups.
Assign rights and privileges to a user or group.
Collect data to periodically review user accounts and their associated rights.
Assign new authentication tokens (e.g., password resets).
Entitlement Administrator:  Entitlement administrators are an optional subset of the account manager role.  Rights and/or responsibilities are assigned to them by the information owner and generally include:
Assign rights and privileges to a user or group.
Collect data to periodically review user accounts and their associated rights.
Maintain any necessary information supporting account administration activities including account management requests and approvals.
Account Types
Account types include:  Individual, Privileged, Service, Shared, Default Non-Privileged (e.g., Guest, Anonymous), Emergency, and Temporary.  All account types must adhere to all applicable rules as defined in the Authentication Tokens Standard.
Individual Accounts: An individual account is a unique account issued to a single user.  The account enables the user to authenticate to systems with a digital identity. After a user is authenticated, the user is authorized or denied access to the system based on the permissions that are assigned directly or indirectly to that user.
Privileged Accounts: A privileged account is an account which provides increased access and requires additional authorization. Examples include a network, system or security administrator account.  A privileged account may only be provided to members of the workforce whom require it to accomplish their job duties. The use of privileged accounts must be compliant with the principle of least privilege. Access will be restricted to only those programs or processes specifically needed to perform authorized business tasks and no more. There are two privileged account types - Administrative Accounts and Default Accounts.
Administrative Accounts: Accounts given to a user that allow the right to modify the operating system or platform settings, or those which allow modifications to other accounts.  These accounts must:
be at an Identity Assurance Level commensurate with the protected resources to which they access.
not have user-IDs that give any indication of the user’s privilege level, e.g., supervisor, manager, administrator, or any flavor thereof.
be internally identifiable as an administrative account per a standardized naming convention.
be revoked in accordance with organizational requirements
Default Privileged Accounts: Default privileged accounts (e.g., root, Administrator) are provided with a particular system and cannot be removed without affecting the functionality of the system. Default privileged accounts must:
be disabled if not in use or renamed if technically possible.
only be used for the initial system installation or as a service account.  When technically feasible, alerts must be issued to the appropriate personnel when there is an attempt to log-in with the account for access.
not use the initial default password provided with the system.
have password known or accessible by at least two individuals within the SE, if password is known by anyone. As such, restrictions for shared accounts, outlined below, must be followed.
Service Accounts: A service account is not intended to be given to a user but is provided for a process.  It is to be used in situations such as to allow a system to run jobs and services independent of user interaction.  Service accounts must:
have an assigned owner responsible for documenting and managing the account.
be restricted to specific devices and hours when possible.
never be used interactively by a user for any purpose other than the initial system installation or if absolutely required for system troubleshooting or maintenance. Wherever technically feasible, administrators should leverage “switch user” (SU) or “run as” for executing processes as service accounts.
never be for any purpose beyond their initial scope.
be internally identifiable as a service account per a standardized naming convention, where possible.
not allow its password to be reset according to any standardized and/or forced schedule.  However, should an employee with knowledge of said password leave the entity, that password must be changed immediately.
have password known or accessible by at least two individuals within the entity, if password is known by anyone. As such, restrictions for shared accounts, outlined below, must be followed.
Shared Accounts:  A shared account is any account where more than one person knows the password and/or uses the same authentication token. Use of shared accounts is only allowed when there is a system or business limitation preventing use of individual accounts.  These cases must be documented by the information owner and reviewed by the Information Security Officer (ISO)/designated security representative. Additional compensatory controls must be implemented to confirm accountability is maintained.  Shared accounts must:
have the tokens (e.g. password) reset when any of its users no longer needs access, or otherwise in accordance with the Authentication Tokens Standard.
be restricted to specific devices and hours when possible.
wherever technically feasible, have its users log on to the system with their individual accounts and “switch user” (SU) or “run as” the shared account.
have strictly limited permissions and access only to the system(s) required.
Default Non-Privileged Accounts: The default non-privileged account (guest or anonymous user) is an account for people who do not have individual accounts.  An example of where this might be necessary is on a public Wi-Fi network.  This account type must:
be disabled until necessary.
have limited rights and permissions.
only be allowed after a risk assessment
have compensatory controls that include restricted network access.
be assigned a password that the user cannot change but that is changed monthly, at a minimum, by an administrator.
not allow the account to be assigned for delegation by another account.
have a log maintained of users to whom the password is given.
Emergency Accounts:  Emergency Accounts are intended for short-term use and include restrictions on creation, point of origin, and usage (i.e., time of day, day of week). SEs may establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes.  Emergency accounts must be automatically disabled after 24 hours.
Temporary Accounts: Temporary accounts are intended for short-term use and include restrictions on creation, point of origin, usage (i.e., time of day, day of week), and must have start and stop dates. An entity may establish temporary accounts as a part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation, such as for vendors, manufacturers, etc. These accounts must have strictly limited permissions and access only to the systems required.
Account Management and Access Control Functions
Automated mechanisms must be employed to monitor the use and management of accounts.  These mechanisms must allow for usage monitoring and notification of atypical account usage. Thresholds for alerting should be set based on the criticality of the system or assurance level of the account.
Staff in the appropriate account management/access control role(s) must be notified when account management activities occur, such as, accounts are no longer required, users are terminated or transferred, or system usage or need-to-know changes.  This should be automated where technically possible.
Automated access control policies that enforce approved authorizations for information and system resources must be in place within systems.  These access control polices could be identity, role or attribute based.
By default, no one has access unless authorized.
The Identity Assurance Level (IAL) of a system determines the degree of certainty required when proofing the identity of a user.  The following table describes the level of confidence associated with each IAL.
Table 1 reflects the standards for account management at each assurance level.
Table 1 – Account Management Standards per Identity Assurance Level
For all Assurance Levels, the following must be adhered to.
Creating New Accounts: To create an account, there must be a valid access authorization based on an approved business justification and a request must be made to create the account.
Modifying Account Attributes (i.e., changing users’ names, demographics, etc.): Modifications must only be made by the authenticated user or an authorized account manager.
Enabling Access: Access is granted, based on the principle of least privilege, with a valid access authorization.
Modifying Access: Access modifications must include a valid authorization.  When there is a position change (not including separation), access is immediately reviewed and removed when no longer needed.
Disabling Accounts/Removing Access:
Event/Risk Based (Administrative Disable): When an account poses or has the potential to pose a significant risk, either the account is disabled and/or access attributes are removed upon discovery of the risk. Close coordination between the information owners, account managers/administrators, legal, incident response stakeholders and human resource managers is essential in order for timely execution of removing or restricting user access.  Significant risk may include a disgruntled employee, or one who has been identified by as a potential risk. Users posing a significant risk to organizations include individuals for whom reliable evidence or intelligence indicates either the intention to use authorized access to information systems to cause harm or through whom adversaries will cause harm. Harm includes potential adverse impacts to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations. An account identifier is required to identify these accounts and prevent inappropriate re-enabling of the account/access.  Re-enabling the account requires explicit approval of the entity, Self-service mechanisms may not be used to re-enable the account.
De-provisioning Upon Separation: All user accounts (including privileged) must be disabled immediately upon separation. In addition, credentials must be revoked in accordance with organizational requirements, and access attributes must be removed.  Self-service mechanisms may not be used to re-enable the account.
Inactivity Disable: When an account is disabled due to inactivity, access attributes may remain unchanged if deemed appropriate by the information owner.
Reviewing Accounts and Access:
Information owners must review all accounts on an annual basis (minimally) to determine if they are still needed.
Access to privileged accounts must be reviewed every six months (minimally) to determine whether or not they are still needed.
Information owners must review account authorizations and/or user access assignments on an annual basis (minimally) to determine if all access is still needed.
Accounts or records of the account must be archived after 5 years of inactivity or after specific audit purposes are met.
Unlocking User Accounts: In order for an administrator or user support agent to unlock an account for a user, the user must be vetted through pre-registered knowledge tokens as per the Authentication Tokens Standard.
Secure Log on Procedures: Where technically feasible, access must be controlled by secure log-on procedures as follows:
Must not display tokens (e.g., password, PIN) being entered.
Must display the following information on completion of a successful log-on:
Date and time of the previous successful log-on; and
Details of any unsuccessful log-on attempts since the last successful log-on.
Session Inactivity Lock: Sessions must be locked after a maximum inactivity period of 15 minutes.  Session inactivity locks are temporary actions taken when users stop work and move away from their immediate vicinity but do not want to log out because of the temporary nature of their absences.  Users must re-authenticate to unlock the session.
Connection Time-out: Sessions must be automatically terminated after 18 hours or after “pre-defined” conditions such as targeted responses to certain types of incidents.
Logging/Auditing/Monitoring: All account activity must be logged and audited in accordance with the Security Logging Standard.  The ability to modify or delete audit records must be limited to a subset of privileged accounts. Any modification to access attributes must be recorded and traceable to a single individual.

FILE: Authentication-Tokens-Standard.docx
================================================================================
1.0 Purpose and Benefits
The purpose of this standard is to list the appropriate authentication tokens that can be used with systems developed or operated that require authenticated access depending on the Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL). This document also provides the requirements for management of those authentication devices.
2.0 Authority
[organization authority]
3.0 Scope
This standard applies to authentication of accounts accessing information technology systems for the purposes of conducting government business electronically.
4.0 Information Statement
Assurance Levels and Required Token Types
The Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) of a system determines the degree of certainty required when authenticating a user. The following table describes the level of confidence associated with each AAL. These levels of assurance are consistent with those established by the U.S. Federal Government for use by federal agencies.
The entity must identify the appropriate assurance level for their system. Each assurance level requires different authentication tokens which incorporate one or more authentication factors (i.e., something you know, something you have, and something you are).  Authenticator Assurance Levels (AAL) 1 and 2 require single factor authentication.  AAL 3 requires multifactor authentication.
Entities must choose the appropriate token type(s) for their assurance level from Tables 1 or 2. Table 1 shows the maximum assurance level that can be achieved with a single token type.
Table 1:  Single-token Options
Entities may use multi-token authentication (i.e., a combination of tokens) to upgrade the overall level of assurance as depicted in Table 2.  For example, AAL3 can be achieved using two tokens rated at AAL2 that represent two different authentication factors (i.e., something you know, something you have, and something you are).
Table 2:  Multi-token Options
Authentication Token Types
Memorized Secret Token
A memorized secret token is something you know.  Memorized secret tokens are typically character or numerical strings.  Examples include passwords, passphrases and Personal Identification Numbers (PINs).
Typically, a memorized secret token is used on its own for AAL 1. AAL 2 and 3 requires multi-factor authentication.  When a memorized secret token is used as one of the factors in a multi-factor authentication solution, the token requirements at the associated AAL apply.
The following table addresses the base minimum requirements regarding Memorized Secret Tokens. Other compliance requirements may require stricter minimum requirements. Relevant compliance domains should be consulted to address specific systems, applications, etc.
Table 3:  Memorized Secret Token Minimum Requirements
Look-Up Secrets
A look-up secret is something you have. It is either a physical or electronic record that stores a set of secrets shared between the user and CSP.  The authenticator is used to look up the appropriate secret(s) needed to respond to a prompt from the verifier.  An example is the use of a look-up secret as a “recovery key” for use when another authenticator is lost or malfunctions.
Look-up secrets are commonly used at AAL 1. AAL 2 and 3 require multifactor authentication. When combined with a memorized secret, the rules at AAL 2 apply.
Authenticator Requirements – Look-up secrets must have at least 20 bits of entropy and must be distributed over a secure channel.
Out-of-Band (OOB) Token
OOB tokens are something you have.  They are a combination of a physical device (e.g., cellular phone, PDA, pager, land line) and a secret that is transmitted to the device over a distinct communications channel, by a verifier for one-time use.
An example of an OOB token would be a user logging into a website and receiving a text message or phone call on their cellular phone (pre-registered with the Credential Service Provider (CSP) during the registration phase) with a random authenticator to be presented as part of the electronic authentication protocol.  E-mail cannot be used to transmit the random authenticator for the OOB device. Authenticator Requirements - The device must be possessed and controlled by the user and uniquely addressable.  The authenticator must establish a separate channel with the verifier to retrieve the out-of-band secret or authentication request. The secondary channel is considered out-of-band (even if it terminates on the same device) if the device does not leak information from one channel to the other without authorization from the claimant.
Use of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) is restricted unless the pre-registered telephone number in use is associated with a specific physical device.  Changing the pre-registered telephone number is equivalent to the binding of a new authenticator and should follow applicable requirements.  Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) or email, must not be used for OOB authentication.
Token Requirements - The token must be possessed and controlled by the user, uniquely addressable and must support communication over a channel/protocol that is separate from the primary channel/protocol for e-authentication.
Uniquely addressable means that the token can be addressed by a unique characteristic (e.g., phone number).
When accessing an application via a mobile device and using a virtual phone and communications management system (i.e., Google Voice), then that mobile device will not be viable as an OOB token as there is no separate channel/protocol for communication of the random authenticator.
A limitation with the use of OOB tokens is that if the device is infected, even if the communication occurs over a separate channel/protocol, both forms of authentication (application access and receipt of token) are compromised and all communication is therefore un-trusted.
Verifier Requirements – The maximum time-period that an OOB token can exist is 10 minutes and it can only be used once.  The verifier-generated secret must have at a minimum 20 bits of entropy, however any authentication secret that has less than 64 bits of entropy must limit the number of failed authentication attempts to no more than 100.
4.2.4 Single Factor (SF) Cryptographic Device
SF cryptographic devices are something you have. It is a hardware device that performs cryptographic operations on input provided to the device.  It does not require a second factor.  Generally, it is a signed message.  An example would be a Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Services (SSL/TLS) certificate.
Authenticator Requirements – The cryptographic modules used shall be validated at FIPS 140-2, Level 1 or higher. Products validated under subsequent versions of FIPS 140 are also acceptable.
Verifier Requirements – The input (e.g., a nonce or challenge) to generate the token has at least 64 bits of entropy and shall either be unique over the authenticator’s lifetime, or statistically unique using and approved random bit generator. Verification must use approved cryptography.
4.2.5 Single-Factor (SF) One-Time Password (OTP) Device
SF OTP devices are something you have.  It is a hardware device that supports the spontaneous generation of OTPs.  This device has an embedded secret that is used as the seed for generation of OTPs and does not require activation through a second factor.  Authentication is accomplished by providing an acceptable OTP and thereby proving user possession and control of the device.  The device is used each time authentication is required.
Examples include key fob tokens. A user attempts to log into a website and provides a token generated code or OTP.
Authenticator Requirements – An approved block cipher or hash function to combine a symmetric key stored on the device with a nonce to generate an OTP must be used. The nonce may be a date and time or a counter generated on the device.
Verifier Requirements - The OTP shall have a limited lifetime, with a maximum of 2 minutes.  The cryptographic module performing the verifier functions shall be validated at FIPS 140-2 Level 1 or higher.  Products validated under subsequent versions of FIPS 140 are also acceptable.
4.2.6 Multi-Factor (MF) Software Cryptographic Token
A MF software cryptographic token is something you have, and it must be unlocked by either something you know or something you are.  It is a cryptographic key that is stored on a disk or some other “soft” media and must be unlocked through a second factor of authentication separate from the authentication factor used to access the disk or other “soft” media.
Authentication is accomplished by proving possession and control of the key.  The token is highly dependent on the specific cryptographic protocol, but it is generally some type of signed message.
An example would be a private cryptographic certificate that is unlocked by a passphrase that is separate from that which unlocks the device on which the certificate is stored.  The certificate deployed on the user’s workstation (something you have) in combination with a passphrase (something you know) provides multi-factor authentication.  The password to access the device cannot automatically unlock the certificate.
Authenticator Requirements - The cryptographic module shall be validated at FIPS 140-2 Level 1 or higher.  Products validated under subsequent versions of FIPS 140 are also acceptable.  Each authentication shall require entry of the password or other activation data and the unencrypted copy of the authentication key shall be erased after each authentication.
Verifier Requirements – Verifier generated token input (e.g., a nonce or challenge) has at least 64 bits of entropy.
4.2.7 Multi-Factor (MF) One-Time Password (OTP) Device
A MF OTP device is something you have, and it must be unlocked by either something you know or something you are.  It is a hardware device that generates OTPs for use in authentication and which must be unlocked through a second factor of authentication.  The second factor of authentication may be achieved through an integral entry pad, an integral biometric (e.g., fingerprint) reader or a direct computer interface (e.g., USB port).
The OTP is typically displayed on the device and manually input to the verifier as a password, although direct electronic input from the device to a computer is also allowed.
An example would be a key fob token in combination with a PIN.  A user attempts to log into a website and provides a user-defined PIN (established when the token was assigned) and a token generated code. The combination of the PIN and token generated code is referred to as a passcode.
Authenticator Requirements - The cryptographic module shall be validated at FIPS 140-2 Level 2 or higher with the token itself meeting physical security at FIPS 140-2 Level 3 or higher.  This means the token is tamper proof; it can’t be broken open to reverse engineer or get a seed value, etc.  Products validated under subsequent versions of FIPS 140 are also acceptable. Refer to the Encryption Standard for additional information.
The OTP must be generated using an approved block cipher or hash function to combine a symmetric key stored on a personal hardware device with a nonce to generate an OTP.  The nonce may be a date and time or a counter generated on the device. Each authentication shall require entry of a password or other activation data through an integrated input mechanism.
Verifier Requirements - The OTP shall have a limited lifetime, with a maximum of 2 minutes.
4.2.8 Multi-Factor (MF) Cryptographic Device
A MF cryptographic device is something you have, and it must be unlocked by either something you know or something you are.  It is a hardware device that contains a protected cryptographic key that must be unlocked through a second authentication factor.
Authentication is accomplished by proving possession of the device and control of the key.  The token is highly dependent on the specific cryptographic device and protocol, but it is generally some type of signed message.  For example, in Transport Layer Services (TLS), there is a “certificate verify” message.  An example would be an ATM card.
Authenticator Requirements - Cryptographic module shall be FIPS 140-2 validated, Level 2 or higher; with the token itself meeting physical security at FIPS 140-2 Level 3 or higher.  This means the token is tamper proof; it can’t be broken open to reverse engineer or get a seed value, etc.  Products validated under subsequent versions of FIPS 140 are also acceptable.
Entry of a password, PIN, or biometric is required to activate the authentication key.  The export of authentication keys is not allowed.
Verifier Requirements – Verifier generated token input (e.g., a nonce or challenge) has at least 64 bits of entropy.
Token Renewal/Re-issuance
All tokens must expire within two years of issuance. A warning notification of token expiration must be provided to the user within a minimum of 14 days of expiration.
Once the token has expired, it will be automatically disabled and/or locked from use.
Some token types support the process of renewal, while some support re-issuance.  Depending on the assurance level, the user will need to re-establish their identity with the CSP if the token has expired or prove possession of the unexpired token before renewal or re-issuance occurs.
5.0 Compliance
This standard shall take effect upon publication. Compliance is expected with all enterprise policies and standards. Policies and standards may be amended at any time.
If compliance with this standard is not feasible or technically possible, or if deviation from this policy is necessary to support a business function, entities shall request an exception through the Chief Information Security Officer’s exception process.

FILE: Cyber-Incident-Response-Standard.docx
================================================================================
1.0 Purpose and Benefits
This standard outlines the general steps for responding to computer security incidents.  In addition to providing a standardized process flow, it (1) identifies the incident response (IR) stakeholders and establishes their roles and responsibilities; (2) describes incident triggering sources, incident types, and incident severity levels; and (3) includes requirements for annual testing, post-incident lessons-learned activities, and collection of IR metrics for use in gauging IR effectiveness.
The goals of IR, as outlined in this standard, are to:
Confirm whether an incident occurred;
Provide a defined incident notification process;
Promote the accumulation and documentation of accurate information;
Establish controls for proper retrieval and handling of evidence;
Contain the incident and stop any unwanted activity quickly and efficiently;
Minimize disruption to network operations;
Provide accurate reports and useful recommendations to management; and
Prevent and/or mitigate future incidents from occurring.

4.0 Information Statement
IR Stakeholder Roles and Responsibilities
In order to respond effectively to a computer security incident, it is critical that all IR stakeholders fully understand not only their roles and responsibilities in the IR process, but also the roles and responsibilities of each IR stakeholder.  This is necessary to (1) avoid duplication of effort; (2) minimize procedural gaps that may occur; and (3) ensure rapid response to computer security incidents.
IR stakeholders include:
Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) – The CISO, or his/her designee, provides for overall coordination of IR including the escalation of an incident.  The CISO leads incident response services for the organization.
Entity Leadership - Provides mainly IR oversight, with their Information Security Officer (ISO) or designee, being the most ‘hands-on’ in terms of IR management activities.
Security Operations Center – The Security Operations (SOC) Center serves as a central group for detection, analysis, tracking, response to and reporting of cyber threats and incidents.  The SOC responds to incidents by providing hands-on technical IR and will recommend steps for staff to remediate and mitigate such that it reduces the likelihood of future incidents.
In addition, the SOC facilitates collaboration and information sharing with other entities that may be experiencing the same or similar incidents, to help resolve the problem more quickly than if done separately.  The SOC collects information on the types of vulnerabilities that are being exploited and the frequency of attacks and shares preventative information to help other organizations protect themselves from similar attacks.
First Responders – IT staff, such as network managers, system administrators, and other technical personnel, will be called upon, as needed, to provide support and tactical response to the Security Operations Center.  All digital forensic analysis must be performed by, or under the direction of, the SOC.
Agency Incident Response Teams –Predefined teams must be ready which include, at minimum, Executive Management, Legal and the Public Information Officer. In some cases, Human Resources and Labor Relations may become involved.
External Entities - In consultation with the Security Operations Center, external entities may conduct hands-on IR activities, such as investigative response activities, or may provide guidance. For example, a security solutions vendor may provide assistance on security appliance settings.  External entities include vendors, service providers, or law enforcement including, but not limited to:
Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC)
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
Internet Service Providers
Security Solutions Vendors
Data Holder Vendors
IR Process Flow
This IR process flow covers how to respond to specific situations for IR stakeholders to ensure an effective and efficient response. The focus of the IR process is to eradicate the problem as quickly as possible, while gathering actionable intelligence, to restore business functions, improve detection, and prevent reoccurrence. An entity can adopt the six step IR process flow as depicted below:
Figure 4.1 – Incident Response Process Flow
Step 1:  Preparation
Proper planning and preparation for an incident before it occurs ensures a more effective and efficient IR process.  Activities associated with this step, include establishing IR teams; updating IR tools, policies/procedures, and forms/checklists; and ensuring IR communication procedures and IR stakeholder contact lists are accurate and up-to-date. An entity must have a defined and up to date Contact List and establish multiple communication channels with all entities and individuals on the IR Contact List.
An entity must assign responsibility for a central point of contact to coordinate identification and reporting up to the CISO. Typically, this is performed by the entity’s designated security representative.  As per the Information Security Policy, all employees are required to report suspected information security incidents or weaknesses to the appropriate manager and designated security representative.
The Security Operations Center will establish standard operating procedures (SOPs) for IR to reflect industry standards and best practice.  These SOPs will be followed during incident response.  Any exception must be documented. The Security Operations Center must routinely vet and validate the tools and techniques used for IR. In order to operate efficiently and effectively, the IR process must be regularly tested.  This must occur at least annually.  This testing can be accomplished with mock incident training or tabletop exercises using realistic scenarios to provide a high-level outline and systematic walkthrough of the IR process and, to the extent possible, must include all IR stakeholders.  These training scenarios must include specific 'discussion points' that represent key learning opportunities, and incorporate lessons-learned, which can then be integrated into the IR process as part of its review.
Step 2:  Identification
Identification involves review of anomalies to determine whether or not an incident has occurred, and, if one has occurred, determining the nature of the incident. Identification begins with an event, an anomaly that has been reported or noticed in a system or network. Detection can be accomplished through technical sources (e.g., operations staff, anti-virus software), non-technical sources (e.g., user security awareness and reporting), or both.
It is important to recognize that not every network or system event will be a security incident. A first responder must be assigned to determine if there is an incident, categorize the incident and escalate as necessary.  Typically, this will be the entity’s designated security representative.
To be effective in IR, incidents must be classified, and escalated as soon as possible to the proper IR stakeholders to promote collaboration and information sharing. Incident classification requires the use of established incident categories together with an incident severity matrix as a means for prioritizing incidents and determining appropriate IR activities.
Incident Categories
It is important to categorize common incidents experienced throughout the enterprise.  By doing so, IR stakeholders can better focus their IR activities.  It should be noted that incidents can have more than one category and categorization may change as the investigation unfolds. An entity can adopt the six (6) US-CERT incident categories as follows:
Table 4.2 – Incident Categories
Incident Severity Matrix
All information security incidents should be categorized according to severity level to assist in determining the extent to which a formal IR is required.  Severity levels are based on the perceived business impact of the incident.  Severity levels may change as the investigation unfolds. General definitions and description of each severity level are as follows:
Table 4.3 – Incident Severity Matrix
Escalation Procedures
During an incident, clear and effective communication is critical.  As such, an escalation procedure should address all lines of communication in the event an incident occurs.  This includes not only internal communication but external communications as well. Communication should flow through all involved IR stakeholders so that everyone has the necessary information to act and carry out their responsibilities in a timely manner.  Notification must be made as soon as possible but should not delay the entity from taking appropriate actions to isolate and contain damage.
Each entity must have an IR escalation procedure that consists of (1) an escalation matrix, (2) an up-to-date contact list with alternate contacts, and (3) multiple communications channels, all in an effort to ensure appropriate and accurate information is disseminated quickly to the appropriate IR stakeholders.
Incident Scoping
Initial scoping is provided by the entity and includes:
Identifying potential targets (e.g., known compromised systems, likely affected systems, key systems);
Defining external touch points (e.g., Internet, wireless, 3rd party, remote access connections);
Prioritizing likely scenarios (e.g., internal vs., external threat, targeted attack vs., target of opportunity); and
Visualizing in-scope environment (e.g., network diagram, data flow).
Considerations for incident scoping activities are as follows:
Relying on relevant and verified evidence sources;
Reducing false positives and volume of data;
Avoiding excessive scope and ‘scope creep’; and
Realizing operational and resource limitations may affect scope.
As additional incident-related information develops during the IR process and as additional stakeholders become involved, an incident typically requires re-scoping.
Incident Tracking & Reporting
A secure centralized tracking system, that can accommodate ‘need to know’ access, leads to a more efficient and systematic IR effort, as well as provides an audit trail should the efforts lead to legal prosecution of the threat.
At a minimum, documentation of the incident must contain the following information:
Date / time the incident was reported
Type of Incident
Reporting source of incident
Summary of the incident
Current status of the incident
All actions taken concerning the incident
Contact information for all involved parties
Evidence gathered during incident investigation
Relevant comments from IR team members
Proposed next steps to be taken
Step 3:  Containment
This step focuses on containing the threat to minimize damage.  It is during this step that information is collected to determine how the attack took place. All affected systems within the enterprise should be identified so that containment (and eradication and recovery) is effective and complete.
Incident containment involves ‘stopping the bleeding’ and preventing the incident from spreading.  Containment can be accomplished by isolating infected systems, blocking suspicious network activity, and disabling services among other actions.  Containment varies for each incident depending on the severity and risk of continuing operations. Entity leadership makes decisions regarding containment measures based on recommendations from the CISO.
Step 4:  Eradication
Eradication involves removing elements of the threat from the enterprise network.  Specific eradication measures depend on the type of incident, number of systems involved, and the types of operating systems and applications involved. Typical eradication measures include reimaging infected systems and enhanced monitoring of system activity.
Analysis of information collected is an iterative process and occurs/reoccurs during both the containment and eradication phases.
Step 5:  Recovery
Once the root cause of an incident has been eradicated, the recovery phase can begin.  The goals of this step are to: (1) remediate any vulnerabilities contributing to the incident (and thus prevent future incidents) and (2) recover by restoring operations to normal.  A phased approach is often used to return systems to normal operation, harden them to prevent similar future incidents and heighten monitoring for an appropriate period of time. Typical recovery activities include rebuilding systems from trusted images/gold standards, restoring systems from clean backups and replacing compromised files with clean versions.
Care must be taken to ensure that files restored from backup do not reintroduce malicious code or vulnerabilities from the incident and that the system is clean and secure before returning to production use. Once recovery has been completed, the IR lead must validate/certify that the incident has been resolved.
Step 6:  Lessons Learned
An IR process is only as good as the ability to execute it successfully.  Lessons learned can be the results of actual IR activities or IR capability testing, and these results should be used to improve the IR process by identifying systemic weaknesses and deficiencies and taking steps to improve on these.  It is important that this take place relatively soon after the incident is closed.
Lessons learned, or post mortem, discussions provide (1) a record of steps taken to respond to an attack, (2) investigative results into determining the root cause of the attack, (3) potential improvements to make, such as IR stakeholder training and certifications, process and procedural updates, and technical modifications.  Knowledge gained can be used in an effort to prevent and/or mitigate future incidents in the form of proactive services.  This may include testing the IR process, conducting vulnerability assessments, providing computer security training, reviewing security policies and procedures, and disseminating cyber security reminders.
Both incident reports and the results of these lesson-learned discussions will be placed into a database for future use and shared with all IR stakeholders for situational awareness and professional development.
Incident Response Metrics
IR metrics must be compiled for each incident and reported to the CISO for enterprise situational awareness when possible and practical.
These metrics allow IR stakeholders (1) to measure IR effectiveness (and reveal potential gaps) over time; (2) identify trends in terms of threat activities and in doing so; (3) to provide justification for additional resources, to include additional personnel, training, and tools.

FILE: Encryption-Standard.docx
================================================================================
1.0 Purpose and Benefits
Encryption is a cryptographic operation that is used to enhance security and protect the electronic data (“data”) by transforming readable information (“plaintext”) into unintelligible information (“ciphertext”).  Encryption is an effective tool in mitigating the threat of unauthorized access to data.
2.0 Authority
[Organization information]
3.0 Scope
This standard applies to all systems, which includes websites and web services, for which the entity has administrative responsibility, including those managed and hosted by third-parties on behalf of the entity.
4.0 Information Statement
The need for encryption of information is based on its classification, risk assessment results, and use case.
Attention must be given to the regulations and national restrictions (e.g., export controls) that may apply to the use of cryptographic techniques in different parts of the world.  The U.S. Government restricts the export, disclosure, or release of encryption technologies to foreign countries or foreign nationals, including “deemed exports” to foreign nationals within the United States (excluding those foreign nationals with permanent resident visas (i.e., Green Cards), U.S. citizenship, or ‘protected person’ status).  If you have any questions, please contact Counsel and Legal Services.
Encryption products for confidentiality of data at rest and data in transit must incorporate Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) approved algorithms for data encryption. Approved encryption algorithms are contained in Appendix A.
Hashing algorithms transform a digital message into a short representation for use in digital signatures and other applications to validate the integrity of the message
Although hash functions such as SHA 1, provide a certain amount of security strength, it does not meet all security requirements for keyed-hash functions such as HMAC SHA 1. Refer to FIPS 180-4 for more information on different types of application hashing algorithms as well as Appendix A.
Hashing algorithms can be used for multiple purposes including but not limited to, digital signatures, message authentication codes, key derivation functions, pseudo random functions.
Approved hashing functions are contained in Appendix A.
Use of outdated, cryptographically broken, proprietary encryption algorithms/hashing functions is prohibited.
Due to the prevalence of incorrectly implemented cryptography, encryption products must have FIPS 140 (Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules) validation and be operated in FIPS mode. Refer to Appendix B - Guidance in Selecting FIPS 140 Validated Products for further information.
Electronic information used to authenticate the identity of an individual or process (i.e., PIN, password, passphrase) must be encrypted when stored, transported or transmitted. This does not include the distribution of a one-time use PIN, password, passphrase, token code, etc., provided it is not distributed along with any other authentication information (e.g., user-ID).
A system’s security plan must include documentation to show appropriate review of encryption methodologies and products.  This will demonstrate due diligence in choosing a method or product that has received substantial positive review by reputable third-party analysts.
Data in Transit
Encryption is required for data in transit in the following situations:
When electronic personally identifying information (PII) is transmitted (including, but not limited to, e-mail, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), instant messaging, e-fax, Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP), etc.).
When encryption of data in transit is prescribed by law or regulation.
When connecting to the internal network(s) over a wireless network.
When remotely accessing an entity’s internal network(s) or devices over a shared (e.g., Internet) or personal (e.g., Bluetooth, infrared) network. This does not apply to remote access over an entity’s managed point to point dedicated connection.
When data is being transmitted with an entity’s public facing website and/or web services, they are required to utilize Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) in lieu of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) where technically feasible. Public facing websites must utilize HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), automatically redirecting HTTP requests to HTTPS websites where technically feasible.  Minimum browser support is listed in Appendix C.
Appropriate encryption methods for data in transit include, but are not limited to, Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 or later, Secure Shell (SSH) 2.0 or later, Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) version 2 or later (with WiFi Protected Setup disabled) and encrypted Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).  Components should be configured to support the strongest cipher suites possible.  Ciphers that are not compliant with this standard must be disabled.
Data at Rest
Encryption is required for data at rest, as follows:
For the systems listed below:
desktops that access or contain personally identifying information (PII);
data stores (including, but not limited to, databases, file shares) that contain PII;
all mobile devices, whether entity issued or third-party, that access or contain any entity information; and
all portable storage devices containing any entity information.
When electronic PII is transported or stored outside of the entity facility.
Full disk encryption is required for all issued laptops that access or contain entity information. Full disk encryption products must use either pre-boot authentication that utilizes the device’s Trusted Platform Module (TPM), or Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) Secure Boot.
To mitigate attacks against encryption keys, when outside of the entity’s facilities, laptops and third-party laptops that access or contain PII must be powered down (i.e., shut down or hibernated) when unattended.
The entity must have a process or procedure in place for confirming devices and media have been successfully encrypted using at least one of the following, listed in preferred order:
automated policy enforcement;
automated inventory system; or
manual record keeping.
Key Management
The entity must ensure that a secure environment is established to protect the cryptographic keys used to encrypt and decrypt information.  Keys must be securely distributed and stored.
Access to keys must be restricted to only individuals who have a business need to access the keys.
Unencrypted keys must not be stored with the data that they encrypt. Keys will be protected with an authentication token that conforms to the identified assurance level.
Compromise of a cryptographic key would cause all information encrypted with that key to be considered unencrypted.  If a compromise has been discovered a new key must be generated and used to continue protection of the encrypted information.  Specific circumstances should be evaluated to determine if a breach notification is required.
Encryption keys and their associated software products must be maintained for the life of the archived data that was encrypted with that product.
5.0 Compliance
This standard shall take effect upon publication. Compliance is expected with all enterprise policies and standards. Policies and standards may be amended at any time.
If compliance with this standard is not feasible or technically possible, or if deviation from this policy is necessary to support a business function, entities shall request an exception through the Chief Information Security Officer’s exception process.

1.0 Purpose and Benefits
This standard outlines a classification process and provides procedures for classifying information in a manner that uniformly protects information entrusted to the entity.
The process of classifying information pursuant to this standard may serve as a basis for an entity to evaluate the retention and disposition schedules currently in effect for its records and, where appropriate, consider revising those schedules to manage the records that must be protected by the entity.
2.0 Authority
[Organization Information]
3.0 Scope
[Organization Scope]
4.0 Information Statement
As per the Information Security Policy, all information and/or information systems must be classified.
Information classification is based on three principles of security: 1) confidentiality, 2) integrity, and 3) availability. For each principle, information can be classified as low, moderate, or high. When classifying the impact, the entity should consider how the information/ information systems is used to accomplish its assigned mission, protect its assets, fulfill its legal responsibilities, maintain its day-to-day functions, and protect individuals. Impact levels are defined as limited, serious, and severe or catastrophic. For the purposes of classification, limited impact shall be deemed to include no impact.
Each entity should review the impact levels in the context of its own operational environment.  Figure 2 shows the Information Asset Classification Categories.
Figure 2: Information Asset Classification Matrix - National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication 199 – Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems
Information Classification Process
The information classification process must include the following:
Identification of information assets;
Classification of information assets; by confidentiality, integrity, and availability (“CIA”); and
Determining controls based upon the classification.
Identification of Information Assets
Identification of information assets involves creating an inventory of all information assets in the entity.  The following items need to be considered when constructing this inventory:
Grouping of information assets
Determining the information owner
Determining the information custodian
Identifying information assets
Grouping of Information Assets
To facilitate the classification of information assets and allow for a more efficient application of controls, it may be desirable to appropriately group information assets together.  A broad grouping may result in applying controls unnecessarily as the asset must be classified at the highest level necessitated by its individual data elements.  For example, if a Human Resources unit decides to classify all of their personnel files as a single information asset and any one of those files contains a name and social security number, the entire grouping would need to be protected with moderate confidentiality controls.
A narrow grouping allows for more precise targeting of controls.  However, as there are more information assets to classify, this increases the complexity of the classification and the management of controls.  Using the previous example, classifying the multitude of personnel files (e.g., appointment letters, timecards, position classifications, holiday waivers) as individual information assets requires a different set of controls for each classification.
In the case of an information technology system, such as a database, data warehouse, or application server, while it may be easier to apply a single set of controls as a result of classifying the system as a single entity, costs may be reduced by applying the controls to the individual elements, such as specific fields, records, or applications.  Therefore, it is important that the entity evaluates the risk and cost benefit of grouping a given set of assets.
Determining the Information Owner
Responsibility for the classification and definition of controls for an information asset belongs to an individual in a managerial position who is ultimately responsible for the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of that information.  If multiple individuals are found to be “owners” of the same information asset, a single individual owner must be designated by a higher level of management.  The information owner is responsible for determining the information’s classification, how and by whom the information will be used.  Owners must understand the uses and risks associated with the information for which they are responsible and any laws, regulations, or policies which govern access and use.  Each owner must exercise due diligence with respect to the proper classification of data in order to prevent improper disclosure and access.
Determining the Information Custodian
Information custodians are people, units, or organizations responsible for implementing the authorized controls for information assets based on the classification level.  An information asset may have multiple custodians.  Based on the information owner’s requirements, the custodian secures the information, applying safeguards appropriate to the information’s classification level.  Information custodians can be from within the entity or from third parties (e.g., another entity). If the custodian is a third party, a formal, written agreement between the custodian’s organization and the entity that owns the information must specify the responsibilities of each party.  An information custodian may also be the information owner.
Identifying Information Assets
For each information asset in their control, the information owner must identify at a minimum:
Source of the information asset (e.g., unit, agency)
Use of the information asset (i.e., purpose/business function)
Business processes dependent on the information asset
Users/groups of users of the information asset
Classification of Information Assets
Owners must answer the questions in the Information Asset Classification Worksheet (Appendix A) to determine the classification of their information assets.  It is appropriate to recruit and work with subject matter experts who have specific knowledge about the information asset, such as Counsel’s Office and the Records Management Officer. The Information Security Officer (ISO)/designated security representative may also be called upon to advise and assist the information owner in determining the classification.  An entity may add more questions to the Information Asset Classification Worksheet but may not alter or remove the original questions.
Information assets are classified according to confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Each of these three principles of security is individually rated as low, moderate, or high. For example, an information asset may have a confidentiality level of “high”, an integrity level of “moderate”, and an availability level of “low” (i.e., HML).
Questions are categorized by confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Each question must be answered sequentially, to the best of the information owners’ abilities.
5.0 Compliance
This standard shall take effect upon publication. Compliance is expected with all enterprise policies and standards. Policies and standards may be amended at any time; compliance with amended policies and standards is expected.
If compliance with this standard is not feasible or technically possible, or if deviation from this policy is necessary to support a business function, entities shall request an exception through the Chief Information Security Officer’s exception process.

APPENDIX B: INFORMATION CLASSIFICATION SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE
Introduction
The classification of information will be the basis for many information security decisions in an organization.  Before deciding the level of resources (i.e., money, time, and technology) required for protection, it is essential that you know what information needs to be protected and the level of protection that is required.  The purpose of this supplement is to provide additional guidance on the information classification process.
Identifying Information Assets
An efficient approach towards identifying information assets is for information owners to maintain an inventory for each information asset in their control. The inventory should minimally include the following:
Source of the information asset (e.g., unit, agency)
Use of the information asset (i.e., purpose/business function)
Business processes dependent on the information asset
Users/groups of users of the information asset
Owner of the information asset
Information assets can be identified using the template provided in Section One of Appendix A or this information can be extracted from an existing information inventory, if available.  Job titles, in place of named individuals, can be used for the custodian, owner, and users in order to ease maintenance of your information asset inventory.  Samples of completed templates are provided below in Figures 1 and 2.
Figure 1: Information Asset Identification Template by Single Asset
Figure 2:  Information Asset Identification Template by Grouped Asset
Information Needed for Determining the Classification
Before determining the classification, it may be beneficial for the information owner to familiarize themselves with the following areas:
Source, Purpose, and Value:
How the information asset is used in supporting business functions.
How often the information asset is used.
How often the information asset is updated.
Dependencies between this information asset and others.
The cost of creating and duplicating the information.
Legal Requirements:
Laws, regulations, policies, or contracts that mandate special security requirements for the information (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)).
Retention requirements for the information asset.
Access Requirements:
Who has/should have access to the information (i.e., people, positions, organizational units).
Whether the information is shared among other units/entities, third-parties, Federal/local governments.
Health and Safety Concerns:
Impact on employees as well as the public.
:
The overall mission of the entity.
The information owner’s role (or unit’s role) in completing the mission.
Non-tangible Effects:
Impact if information asset is not available (temporarily or permanently).
The effect of a breach of confidentiality, integrity, or availability on the intangible assets of the entity such as reputation, trust and morale.
Classification of Information Assets
Classification of information assets is facilitated by the use of a series of questions.  The answers will help determine the information asset classification.
The Information Asset Classification Worksheet, found in Appendix A, contains the confidentiality, integrity, and availability questions that must be answered when classifying information.  Following are example answers to assist in determining the appropriate response.
Confidentiality Questions
Is the information publicly available?
Example(s):  Information that must be lawfully made available to the general public from Federal, State, or local government records or information that does not need to be withheld for security, legal or privacy concerns is generally deemed publicly available. Examples include public transportation schedules, a listing of local city events, or health improvement guidelines.  These items would be ranked low in confidentiality.
Does the information include or contain personally identifying information (PII)?
Example(s): A W-2 form contains a name, as well as a social security number.  This would be considered private information and therefore have a minimum confidentiality of moderate, which may be adjusted based on responses to subsequent impact questions.
[3] What impact does unauthorized disclosure of information have on health and personal safety?
Example(s):  There may be information which, if publicly released, may impact the health and personal safety of the entity’s workforce and citizens such as, the blueprint and drawings of critical infrastructure buildings, critical infrastructure related systems, network configurations, or disaster recovery/business continuity plans. These could be exploited by criminals to sabotage or destroy buildings, emergency services, or critical infrastructure operations resulting in a severe impact to health and personal safety of citizens thereby placing these items in the high confidentiality category.
[4] What is the financial or agency liability impact of unauthorized disclosure of information?
Example(s):  The entity may be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines due to disclosure of information protected by law or confidentiality agreements. For instance, unauthorized release of vendor bid information containing bidder’s proprietary information could jeopardize the bidding process as well as potentially expose the organization to litigation.
Similarly, if the investment decisions of the entity’s retirement system become known prior to their execution, it could alter the market sentiment ahead of the investment causing financial losses.
[5] What impact does unauthorized release of sensitive information have on the entity mission?
Example(s):  An entity may be charged with ensuring that illegal goods do not enter.  As part of that mission, the entity may be responsible for collecting and maintaining information regarding unmanned border crossings.  If there was an unauthorized release of that information, resulting in an increase of illegal traffic, it could have a severe impact on the entity’s ability to fulfill its mission.
An example of limited impact would be the release of employee contact information which may result in additional phone calls/emails/office visits.
If a list of local delivery restaurants and their phone numbers is disclosed, there would be no impact.
[6] What impact does unauthorized disclosure of information have on the entity’s intangible assets such as the public trust, agency reputation, and public interests?
Example(s): It is important for the government to maintain the public’s trust.   For example, the unauthorized exposure of medical records could lead to a loss of the public trust in the entity’s ability to protect sensitive information.
An entity which collects and maintains the confidential records of citizens requires a high level of public trust. Unauthorized disclosure of data through the actions of a malicious insider, external hacker, or through a random accident could erode the public’s trust in the SE and their ability to protect citizen data.
[7] Is confidentiality mandated by law or regulation?  If yes, determine the impact of   unauthorized  disclosure of information.
Example(s):  Some types of information, including personal health records, student grades, and financial and personnel records may be protected by Federal, State, and local laws or regulations. Disclosing this information can lead to civil or criminal liability. There are several key statutes, such as HIPAA, that should be examined based on the information asset being classified.
[8]	Is the information intended for limited distribution?  If yes, determine the impact of the unauthorized  disclosure of that information.
Example(s):  Some information generated within an entity is for internal use only and is not meant to be disclosed externally. The confidentiality of such information varies considerably based on the information asset. Information, such as system security configurations, which, if released, could jeopardize the security of an entity’s assets, would require high confidentiality controls.
Administrative information, such as procedures for travel approval, though not publicized outside the entity, would be information that the public could legitimately obtain and should be ranked as low in confidentiality.
Integrity Questions
Does the information include medical records?
Example(s):  In the case of a health care institution, it is important that medical records and medical history are accurate. For example, it may be important to know whether someone is allergic to specific medications so that they are not administered. In addition, it would be necessary to know whether a person has a particular illness or medical condition which would require special treatment. Malicious or accidental alteration of a patient’s health records  can cause serious health consequences for that individual.  Medical records require a minimum integrity classification of moderate.  This rating may be adjusted based on responses to subsequent questions.
Is the information relied upon to make critical security decisions?
Example(s):  It is important that security records (e.g., computer security logs, building security access logs) are accurate in order to verify legitimate access and identify unauthorized access attempts.  Security related records require a minimum integrity classification of moderate.  This rating may be adjusted based on responses to subsequent questions.
What impact does unauthorized modification or destruction of information have on health and safety?
Example(s):  There is a potential for severe impact on the safety of citizens if someone accesses an airline system and modifies the onboard navigation system.
The removal or editing of surveillance tapes may have a serious or severe impact depending on the presence of additional information provided by other forms of surveillance.
Something that could be of low to no impact on health and safety would be the unauthorized modification of an employee’s calendars.
[4] What is the financial impact of unauthorized modification or destruction of information?
Example(s):  There are many financial implications for the destruction or modification of information. It does not strictly mean monetary loss, but can also include loss of employee time and effort for recovery. Something that would have severe financial impact might be the loss of all financial records from an entity’s financial management database.
If a database of vendor contact information was deleted, it would involve effort in re-creating the database. This would probably be of limited impact.
[5] What impact does unauthorized modification or destruction of information have on the entity mission?
Example(s):  Entity operations could be drastically affected if information is changed without authorization.  For example, if someone removed all the phone numbers in a Do Not Call registry, it would severely impact the mission of the program to prevent unwanted calls to registered numbers.
The mission of a university is to provide education and certify the qualifications of students through academic degrees. Malicious or accidental changes to student’s academic records would have a severe impact on the university’s mission of issuing academic credentials.
[6] What impact does unauthorized modification or destruction of information have on the public trust?
Example(s):  The public relies on government to provide accurate information.  Failure to do so would erode public trust.  For example, if information on certification for licensed professionals was inaccurately modified without authorization and then posted to a public web site, the public would no longer trust the entity posting the information as a reputable source for this information.
[7] Is integrity addressed by law or regulation?  If yes, determine the impact of unauthorized modification or destruction of information.
Example(s):  Some types of information, including personal health records, student grades, and financial and personnel records, may be protected by Federal, State, and local laws. Allowing unauthorized changes to information may have legal consequences. There are several key statutes that should be examined based on the information asset being classified.  For example, HIPAA requires safeguards to protect against threats to the integrity of electronic protected health information .
[8] Is the information (e.g., financial transactions, performance appraisals) relied upon to make business decisions?  If yes, determine the impact of unauthorized modification or destruction of that information.
Example(s):  It is important for financial information to remain reliable. Unauthorized changes to financial transactions (e.g., direct deposit, electronic funds transfer) could severely impact the financial stability of an entity.
Employee appraisal records are used to make important personnel decisions. Someone may attempt to falsify records in hopes of getting a promotion, alternate employment, or to diminish someone else’s reputation and/or record.  The impact to the entity could vary dependent upon the situation.
Availability Questions
[1] This information needs to be provided or available:
As time permits
Within 1 to 7 days
24 hrs. per day/7 days a week
Example(s):  Intrusion detection systems send event notifications so that an incident can be analyzed and escalated based on the level of threat. Since security is critical, and severe damage can be caused to entity data and networks, this operation is time critical and requires high availability (24 hrs. per day/7 days a week).
[2] What is the impact to health and safety if information were not available when needed?
Example(s):  Medical records contain information (e.g., allergies, blood type, previous medications) which is critical for providing patients with accurate medical care.  Lack of availability to this data during emergency medical care can lead to life threatening situations therefore placing these items in the high availability (24 hrs. per day/7 days a week) category.
[3] What is the financial impact if information were not available when needed?
Example(s):  For any entity where online services generate revenue, a disruption of service can have a financial impact which could be deemed severe.
A personal computer system crash which can be solved by a simple reboot would have limited impact.
[4] What is the impact to the entity mission if information were not available when needed?
Example(s):  Public transportation’s mission is to get customers quickly and efficiently to various locations.  If access to train, bus, and subway schedules was unavailable, this could lead to an inability of public transportation to fulfill its mission.  The impact to its mission would be severe.
[5] What is the impact to the public trust if the information were not available when needed?
Example(s):  Entities have spent considerable effort modernizing operations to include online services and encouraging the public to use these services.  If these services were seriously degraded or disrupted, this could cause serious embarrassment to the entity resulting in a severe impact and an erosion of the public’s trust in the entity and the online services. The availability in this case would be high.

FILE: Information-Security-Policy.docx
================================================================================
1.0 Purpose and Benefits
This policy defines the mandatory minimum information security requirements for the entity as defined below in Section 3.0 Scope. Any entity may, based on its individual business needs and specific legal and federal requirements, exceed the security requirements put forth in this document, but must, at a minimum, achieve the security levels required by this policy.
This policy acts as an umbrella document to all other security policies and associated standards.  This policy defines the responsibility to:
protect and maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information and related infrastructure assets;
manage the risk of security exposure or compromise;
assure a secure and stable information technology (IT) environment;
identify and respond to events involving information asset misuse, loss or unauthorized disclosure;
monitor systems for anomalies that might indicate compromise; and
promote and increase the awareness of information security.
Failure to secure and protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information assets in today’s highly networked environment can damage or shut down systems that operate critical infrastructure, financial and business transactions and vital government functions; compromise data; and result in legal and regulatory non-compliance.
This policy benefits entities by defining a framework that will assure appropriate measures are in place to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data; and assure staff and all other affiliates understand their role and responsibilities, have adequate knowledge of security policy, procedures and practices and know how to protect information.
2.0 Authority
[Organization information]
3.0 Scope
This policy encompasses all systems, automated and manual, for which the entity has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the entity. It addresses all information, regardless of the form or format, which is created or used in support of business activities.
4.0 Information Statement
Organizational Security
Information security requires both an information risk management function and an information technology security function.  Depending on the structure of the entity, an individual or group can serve in both roles or a separate individual or group can be designated for each role.  It is recommended that these functions be performed by a high-level executive or a group that includes high level executives.
Each entity must designate an individual or group to be responsible for the risk management function assuring that:
risk-related considerations for information assets and individual information systems, including authorization decisions, are viewed as an enterprise with regard to the overall strategic goals and objectives of carrying out its core missions and business functions; and
the management of information assets and information system-related security risks is consistent, reflects the risk tolerance, and is considered along with other types of risks, to ensure mission/business success.
Each entity must designate an individual or group to be responsible for the technical information security function.   For purposes of clarity and readability, this policy will refer to the individual, or group, designated as the Information Security Officer (ISO)/designated security representative.  This function will be responsible for evaluating and advising on information security risks.
Information security risk decisions must be made through consultation with both function areas described in a. above.
Although the technical information security function may be outsourced to third parties, each entity retains overall responsibility for the security of the information that it owns.
Functional Responsibilities
Executive management is responsible for:
evaluating and accepting risk on behalf of the entity;
identifying information security responsibilities and goals and integrating them into relevant processes;
supporting the consistent implementation of information security policies and standards;
supporting security through clear direction and demonstrated commitment of appropriate resources;
promoting awareness of information security best practices through the regular dissemination of materials provided by the ISO/designated security representative;
implementing the process for determining information classification and categorization, based on industry recommended practices, organization directives, and legal and regulatory requirements, to determine the appropriate levels of protection for that information;
implementing the process for information asset identification, handling, use, transmission, and disposal based on information classification and categorization;
determining who will be assigned and serve as information owners while maintaining ultimate responsibility for the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data;
participating in the response to security incidents;
complying with notification requirements in the event of a breach of private information;
adhering to specific legal and regulatory requirements related to information security;
communicating legal and regulatory requirements to the ISO/designated security representative; and
communicating requirements of this policy and the associated standards, including the consequences of non-compliance, to the workforce and third parties, and addressing adherence in third party agreements.
The ISO/designated security representative is responsible for:
maintaining familiarity with business functions and requirements;
maintaining an adequate level of current knowledge and proficiency in information security through annual Continuing Professional Education (CPE) credits directly related to information security;
assessing compliance with information security policies and legal and regulatory information security requirements;
evaluating and understanding information security risks and how to appropriately manage those risks;

advising on security issues related to procurement of products and services;
escalating security concerns that are not being adequately addressed according to the applicable reporting and escalation procedures;
disseminating threat information to appropriate parties;
participating in the response to potential security incidents;
participating in the development of enterprise policies and standards  that considers the entity’s needs; and
promoting information security awareness.
IT management is responsible for:
supporting security by providing clear direction and consideration of security controls in the data processing infrastructure and computing network(s) which support the information owners;
providing resources needed to maintain a level of information security control consistent with this policy;
identifying and implementing all processes, policies and controls relative to security requirements defined by the business and this policy;
implementing the proper controls for information owned based on the classification designations;
providing training to appropriate technical staff on secure operations (e.g., secure coding, secure configuration);
fostering the participation of information security and technical staff in protecting information assets, and in identifying, selecting and implementing appropriate and cost-effective security controls and procedures; and
implementing business continuity and disaster recovery plans.
The workforce is responsible for:
understanding the baseline information security controls necessary to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information entrusted;
protecting  information and resources from unauthorized use or disclosure;
protecting personal, private, sensitive information from unauthorized use or disclosure;
abiding by Acceptable Use of Information Technology Resources Policy
reporting suspected information security incidents or weaknesses to the appropriate manager and ISO/designated security representative.
The CISO is responsible for:

developing the security program and strategy, including measures of effectiveness;
establishing and maintaining enterprise information security policy and standards;
assessing compliance with security policies and standards;
advising on secure system engineering;
providing incident response coordination and expertise;
monitoring networks for anomalies;
monitoring external sources for indications of data breaches, defacements, etc.
maintaining ongoing contact with security groups/associations and relevant authorities;
providing timely notification of current threats and vulnerabilities; and
providing awareness materials and training resources.
Separation of Duties
To reduce the risk of accidental or deliberate system misuse, separation of duties and areas of responsibility must be implemented where appropriate.
Whenever separation of duties is not technically feasible, other compensatory controls must be implemented, such as monitoring of activities, audit trails and management supervision.
The audit and approval of security controls must always remain independent and segregated from the implementation of security controls.
Information Risk Management
Any system or process that supports business functions must be appropriately managed for information risk and undergo information risk assessments, at a minimum annually, as part of a secure system development life cycle.
Information security risk assessments are required for new projects, implementations of new technologies, significant changes to the operating environment, or in response to the discovery of a significant vulnerability.
Entities are responsible for selecting the risk assessment approach they will use based on their needs and any applicable laws, regulations, and policies.
Risk assessment results, and the decisions made based on these results, must be documented.
Associated Standard:  Information Security Risk Management Standard;
Secure System Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) Standard
Information Classification and Handling
All information, which is created, acquired or used in support of business activities, must only be used for its intended business purpose.
All information assets must have an information owner established within the lines of business.
Information must be properly managed from its creation, through authorized use, to proper disposal.
All information must be classified on an ongoing basis based on its confidentiality, integrity and availability characteristics.
An information asset must be classified based on the highest level necessitated by its individual data elements.
If the entity is unable to determine the confidentiality classification of information or the information is personal identifying information (PII) the information must have a high confidentiality classification and, therefore, is subject to high confidentiality controls.
Merging of information which creates a new information asset or situations that create the potential for merging (e.g., backup tape with multiple files) must be evaluated to determine if a new classification of the merged data is warranted.
All reproductions of information in its entirety must carry the same confidentiality classification as the original. Partial reproductions need to be evaluated to determine if a new classification is warranted.
Each classification has an approved set of baseline controls designed to protect these classifications and these controls must be followed.
The entity must communicate the requirements for secure handling of information to its workforce.
A written or electronic inventory of all information assets must be maintained.
Content made available to the general public must be reviewed according to a process that will be defined and approved by the entity. The process must include the review and approval of updates to publicly available content and must consider the type and classification of information posted.
PPI must not be made available without appropriate safeguards approved by the entity.
For non-public information to be released outside the entity or shared between other entities, a process must be established that, at a minimum:
evaluates and documents the sensitivity of the information to be released or shared;
identifies the responsibilities of each party for protecting the information;
defines the minimum controls required to transmit and use the information;
records the measures that each party has in place to protect the information;
defines a method for compliance measurement;
provides a signoff procedure for each party to accept responsibilities; and
establishes a schedule and procedure for reviewing the controls.
Associated Standards: Information Classification Standard; Sanitization/Secure Disposal Standard
IT Asset Management
All IT hardware and software assets must be assigned to a designated business unit or individual.
Entities are required to maintain an inventory of hardware and software assets, including all system components (e.g., network address, machine name, software version) at a level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting.  This inventory must be automated where technically feasible.
Processes, including regular scanning, must be implemented to identify unauthorized hardware and/or software and notify appropriate staff when discovered.
Associated Standard: Secure Configuration Standard
Personnel Security
The workforce must receive general security awareness training, to include recognizing and reporting insider threats, within 30 days of hire.  Additional training on specific security procedures, if required, must be completed before access is provided to specific entity sensitive information not covered in the general security training.  All security training must be reinforced at least annually and must be tracked by the entity.
An entity must require its workforce to abide by the Acceptable Use of Information Technology Resources Policy, and an auditable process must be in place for users to acknowledge that they agree to abide by the policy’s requirements.
All job positions must be evaluated by the to determine whether they require access to sensitive information and/or sensitive information technology assets.
For those job positions requiring access to sensitive information and sensitive information technology assets, entities must conduct workforce suitability determinations, unless prohibited from doing so by law, regulation or contract.  Depending on the risk level, suitability determinations may include, as appropriate and permissible, evaluation of criminal history record information or other reports from federal, state and private sources that maintain public and non-public records.  The suitability determination must provide reasonable grounds for the entity to conclude that an individual will likely be able to perform the required duties and responsibilities of the subject position without undue risk to the entity.
A process must be established within the entity to repeat or review suitability determinations periodically and upon change of job duties or position.
Entities are responsible for ensuring all issued property is returned prior to an employee’s separation and accounts are disabled and access is removed immediately upon separation.
Associated Standard: Account Management/Access Control Standard
Cyber Incident Management
Entities must have an incident response plan, consistent standards, to effectively respond to security incidents.
All observed or suspected information security incidents or weaknesses are to be reported to appropriate management and the ISO/designated security representative as quickly as possible.  If a member of the workforce feels that cyber security concerns are not being appropriately addressed, they may confidentially contact the Security Operations Center directly.
The Security Operations Center must be notified of any cyber incident which may have a significant or severe impact on operations or security, or which involves digital forensics, to follow proper incident response procedures and guarantee coordination and oversight.
Associated Standard: Cyber Incident Response Standard
Physical and Environmental Security
Information processing and storage facilities must have a defined security perimeter and appropriate security barriers and access controls.
A periodic risk assessment must be performed for information processing and storage facilities to determine whether existing controls are operating correctly and if additional physical security measures are necessary.  These measures must be implemented to mitigate the risks.

FILE: Information-Security-Risk-Management-Standard.docx
================================================================================
1.0 Purpose and Benefits
Risk management is a critical component of any information security program.  It helps ensure that any risk to confidentiality, integrity, and availability is identified, analyzed, and maintained at acceptable levels.  Risk assessments allow management to prioritize and focus on areas that pose the greatest impact to critical and sensitive information assets. This provides the foundation for informed decision-making regarding information security.
Federal and State mandates require routine assessments to identify risk and ensure appropriate controls. Risk assessments allow alignment of information security with business objectives and regulatory requirements.  Identifying information security risk and considering control requirements from the onset is essential, and far less costly than retrofitting or addressing the impact of a security incident.
This standard provides a risk management framework to evaluate current security posture, identify gaps, and determine appropriate actions.
2.0 Authority
[Entity Authority Needed]
3.0 Scope
[Entity Scope Needed]
4.0 Information Statement
Information security risk management takes into account vulnerabilities, threat sources, and security controls that are planned or in place.  These inputs are used to determine the resulting level of risk posed to information, systems, processes, and individuals that support business functions.
While risk management and related assessment activities can take many forms (e.g., formal risk assessment, audits, security reviews, configuration analysis, vulnerability scanning and testing), all are aimed at the same goal - identifying and acting on risk to improve overall security posture.
It should be noted that an entity can never completely eliminate risk, but can take steps to manage risk.
As per the Information Security Policy, any system or process that supports business functions must be appropriately managed for risk and undergo risk assessments as part of its life cycle.
Risk Management Process
The risk management process is iterative and should be followed throughout a system’s or process’s life cycle.
Frame Risk
The first step in managing risk is to:
develop a strategy for conducting your risk assessment which considers assumptions, constraints, priorities, dependencies, tradeoffs and resources that will be used; and
determine the risk tolerance, or the level of risk that is acceptable. For information security risk decisions that may affect multiple entities, the lowest level of risk tolerance for those entities must prevail.  It is important that entities recognize how fundamental this decision is to the risk management process. Risk tolerance is an executive-level decision and information technology (IT) staff should not be determining the risk tolerance for an entity.
Assess Risk
Assessing risk starts with identifying and classifying assets within scope. Risk is assessed by determining the threats and vulnerabilities to these assets, identifying the potential impact of each vulnerability being exploited, and determining the likelihood of occurrence.  A list of potential threats and vulnerabilities needs to be developed, and may come from preexisting resources.
It is important to note that the risk assessment process is comprehensive by intention, to assure due diligence, compliance, and proper documentation of security related controls and considerations.
Designing security into systems requires an investment of time and resources.  The extent of the risk assessment should be commensurate with the classification (information sensitivity and system criticality) of the system/process and the risks this system/process introduces into the overall environment.
Types of information security risk assessments include, but are not limited to:
Enterprise Risk Assessments – Assesses risks to core agency assets, operational processes, and functions;
Physical Infrastructure Assets and Systems Risk Assessments – Identifies and assesses vulnerabilities and risks to core physical infrastructure assets and systems;
Project Security Risk Assessments (New Risks) – Identifies and assesses new risks to existing components introduced by new technology or service offerings; and
Change Request Risk Assessments – Assesses risk of change to ensure security is not compromised by the proposed change.
Respond to Risk
Once risk has been assessed, the entity must determine and implement the appropriate course of action.  Options include:
Risk Acceptance – This is a documented decision not to act on a given risk at a given time and place.  It is not negligence or “inaction” and can be appropriate if the risk falls within the risk tolerance level.  For example, entities may choose to accept the risk of an earthquake, based on a low likelihood in the Northeast of extensive damage and the high cost of controls.
Risk Avoidance – These are specific actions taken to eliminate the activities or technologies that are the basis for the risk.  This is appropriate when the identified risk exceeds the risk tolerance, even after controls have been applied (i.e., residual risk).  For example, if a connection between two networks includes unacceptable risks and the countermeasures are not practical, the entity may decide not to make the connection.
Risk Mitigation/Reduction – These are specific actions taken to eliminate or reduce risk to an acceptable level.  This is the most common approach and is appropriate where controls can reduce the identified risk.  For example, to reduce the risk of network intrusion, an entity may choose to deploy a firewall.
Risk Transfer/Sharing – These are specific actions taken to shift responsibility for the risk, in whole or in part, to a third party.  This may be appropriate when it is more cost effective to transfer the risk, or when a third party is better suited to manage the risk.  For example, an entity may transfer risk through legal disclaimers or by outsourcing to a vendor.
Monitor Risk
The entity must monitor the effectiveness of its risk response measures, by verifying that the controls put in place are implemented correctly and operating as intended. This must occur annually, at a minimum.  In addition, the entity must have a process to alert it of significant changes in the factors it uses to assess its risk (e.g., assets, threats, controls, regulations, policies, risk tolerance). These changes may indicate a new assessment is needed.
5.0 Compliance
This standard shall take effect upon publication. Compliance is expected with all enterprise policies and standards. Policies and standards may be amended at any time.
If compliance with this standard is not feasible or technically possible, or if deviation from this policy is necessary to support a business function, entities shall request an exception through the Chief Information Security Officer’s exception process.

================================================================================
1.0 Purpose and Benefits
Mobile devices often need additional protection because their nature generally places them at higher exposure to threats than other client devices that are only used within an entity’s facilities and on the entity’s networks. This standard outlines the additional protections required for the use of mobile devices.
2.0 Authority
[Authority Needed]
3.0 Scope
[Scope Needed]
4.0 Information Statement
Mobile devices are computing devices in a small form factor that have at least one network connection interface, non-removable and/or removable storage, and is portable (i.e., non-stationary). These devices come in the forms such as: smartphones, PDAs, smart watches, tablets, laptops, and wearable devices. Mobile devices must follow all requirements of the Information Security Policy.
As per the Encryption Standard, all mobile devices that access or contain any entity information must be encrypted.
For entity issued mobile devices or personal mobile devices with direct access to managed networks, only those applications which are approved may be installed and or run on the mobile devices.  Applications must be restricted through the use of whitelisting (preferable) or blacklisting.  Applications must be digitally signed to ensure that only applications from trusted entities are installed on the device and that code has not been modified.
Entity information must be removed or rendered inaccessible from mobile devices after no more than 10 incorrect authentication attempts.
Mobile devices must automatically lock after being idle for a period not to exceed 10 minutes.
Mobile devices which directly connect to managed private networks, virtually connect to managed private networks in a manner consistent with a directly connected device, or which contain or could contain information, including e-mail data, must be managed by a Mobile Device Management (MDM) or other centralized management solution.
Use of synchronization services, such as backups, for mobile devices (e.g., local device synchronization, remote synchronization services, and websites) must be controlled through an MDM or other centralized management solution.
Mobile devices may not access private networks unless their operating environment integrity is verified (including whether the device has been rooted/jailbroken).
Entities must manage all mobile devices by:
Implementing device policies and configurations as appropriate to the use of the device.
Developing and implementing processes which check for upgrades and patches to the software components, and for appropriately acquiring, testing, and deploying the updates to entity issued devices.
Reconfiguring access control features as needed based on factors such as policy changes, technology changes, audit findings, and new security needs.
Detecting and documenting anomalies which may indicate malicious activity or deviations from policy and procedures. Anomalies should be reported to other systems’ administrators as appropriate.
Providing training and awareness activities for mobile device users on threats and recommended security practices which can be incorporated into the entity’s security and awareness training.
5.0 Compliance
This standard shall take effect upon publication.  Compliance is expected with all enterprise policies and standards.  Entities may amend its policies and standards at any time; compliance with amended policies and standards is expected.

FILE: Patch-Management-Standard.docx
================================================================================
1.0 Purpose and Benefits
Security patch management (patch management) is a practice designed to proactively prevent the exploitation of IT vulnerabilities that exist within an organization. By applying security related software or firmware updates (patches) to applicable IT systems, the expected result is reduced time and money spent dealing with exploits by reducing or eliminating the related vulnerability.
2.0 Authority
[Organization Authority Needed]
3.0 Scope
This standard relates specifically to vulnerabilities that can be addressed by a software or firmware update (patch) and applies to all software used on the entity’s systems.  The Vulnerability Scanning Standard should be followed for requirements on addressing non-patched vulnerabilities.
4.0 Information Statement
Entities must assign an individual or group within IT operations to be responsible for patch management.
If patch management is outsourced, service level agreements must be in place that address the requirements of this standard and outline responsibilities for patching.  If patching is the responsibility of the third party, entities must verify that the patches have been applied.
A process must be in place to manage patches.  This process must include the following:
monitoring security sources (Appendix A) for vulnerabilities, patch and non-patch remediation, and emerging threats;
overseeing patch distribution, including verifying that a change control procedure is being followed;
testing for stability and deploying patches; and
using an automated centralized patch management distribution tool, whenever technically feasible, which:
maintains a database of patches;
deploys patches to endpoints; and
verifies installation of patches.
Appropriate separation of duties must exist so that the individual(s) verifying patch distribution is not the same individual(s) who is distributing the patches.
As per the Information Security Policy, all entities must maintain an inventory of hardware and software assets.  Patch management must incorporate all installed IT assets.
Patch management must be prioritized based on the severity of the vulnerability the patch addresses.  In most cases, severity ratings are based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). A CVSS score of 7-10 is considered a high impact vulnerability, a CVSS score of 4-6.9 is considered a moderate impact vulnerability and a CVSS of 0-3.9 is considered a low impact vulnerability.
To the extent possible, the patching process must follow the timeline contained in the table below:
If patching cannot be completed in the timeframe listed in the table above, compensating controls must be put in place within the timeframes above and the exception process must be followed.
If a patch requires a reboot for installation, the reboot must occur within the timeframes outlined above.
5.0 Compliance
This standard shall take effect upon publication. Compliance is expected with all enterprise policies and standards.  Policies and standards may be amended at any time.
If compliance with this standard is not feasible or technically possible, or if deviation from this policy is necessary to support a business function, entities shall request an exception through the Chief Information Security Officer’s exception process.

FILE: Sanitization-Secure-Disposal-Standard.docx
================================================================================
1.0 Purpose and Benefits
Information systems capture, process, and store information using a wide variety of media, including paper. This information is not only located on the intended storage media but also on devices used to create, process, or transmit this information. These media may require special disposition in order to mitigate the risk of unauthorized disclosure of information and to ensure its confidentiality.
2.0 Authority
[Authority Needed]
3.0 Scope
[Scope Needed]
4.0 Information Statement
As per the Information Security Policy, information must be properly managed from its creation, through authorized use, to proper disposal.
The entity must ensure that users and custodians of information are aware of its sensitivity and the basic requirements for media sanitization and secure disposal.
The entity must ensure that all workforce members, including property management and custodial staff, are made aware of the media sanitization and secure disposal process in order to establish proper accountability for all data.
The entity must ensure that confidential material is destroyed only by authorized and trained personnel, whether in-house or contracted, using methods outlined in this standard.
The entity may use service providers for destruction purposes provided that the information remains secure until the destruction is completed.  The service providers must follow this standard. The entity must ensure that maintenance or contractual agreements are in place and are sufficient in protecting the confidentiality of the system media and information commensurate with the information classification standards.
Methods of Media Sanitization
The following table depicts the three types of sanitization methods and the impact of each method.
Sanitization Decision Process
The decision process is based on the confidentiality of the information, not the type of media. The entities choose the type of sanitization to be used, and the type of sanitization is approved by the Information Owner.  The technique used may vary by media type and by the technology available to the custodian, so long as the requirements of the sanitization type are met.  Recommended Sanitization techniques for specific types of media are outlined in Appendix A of NIST 800-88, Rev. 1, Guidelines for Media Sanitization, Minimum Sanitization Recommendations.
Disposal without sanitization should be considered only if information disclosure would have no impact on organizational mission, would not result in damage to organizational assets, and would not result in financial loss or harm to any individuals.
The security categorization of the information, along with internal environmental factors, should drive the decisions on how to deal with the media. The key is to first think in terms of information confidentiality, then apply considerations based on media type.
Figure 4.1- Sanitization and Disposition Decision Flow
(from NIST 800-88, Rev. 1, Guidelines for Media Sanitization)
The cost versus benefit of a sanitization process should be understood prior to a final decision. Entities can always increase the level of sanitization applied if that is reasonable and indicated by an assessment of the existing risk. For example, even though Clear or Purge may be the recommended solution, it may be more cost-effective (considering training, tracking, and validation, etc.) to destroy media rather than use one of the other options. Entities may not decrease the level of sanitization required.
Control of Media
A factor influencing a sanitization decision is who has control and access to the media. This aspect must be considered when media leaves organizational control. Media control may be transferred when media are returned from a leasing agreement or are being donated or resold to be reused outside the organization. The following are examples of media control:
Under SE Control:
Media being turned over for maintenance are still considered under the entity’s control if contractual agreements are in place and the maintenance provider specifically provides for the confidentiality of the information.
Maintenance being performed on an entity’s site, under the entity’s supervision, by a maintenance provider is also considered under the control of the entity.
Not Under Entity Control:
Media that are being exchanged for warranty, cost rebate, or other purposes and where the specific media will not be returned to the entity are considered to be out of the entity’s control.
Reuse of Media
Entities should consider the cost versus benefit of reuse. It may be more cost-effective (considering training, tracking, and validation, etc.) to destroy media rather than use one of the other options.
Clear / Purge / Destroy
Table 5-1 – Sanitization Methods
(from NIST 800-88, Rev. 1, Guidelines for Media Sanitization)
Validation
Entities must test a representative sampling of media for proper sanitization to assure that proper protection is maintained.
Verification of Equipment
If the entity is using sanitization tools (e.g., a degausser), the entity must have procedures to ensure that the tools are operating effectively.
Verification of Personnel Competencies
Entities must ensure that equipment operators are properly trained and competent to perform sanitization functions.
Document
Entities must maintain a record of their sanitization to document what media were sanitized, when, how they were sanitized, and the final disposition of the media.
5.0 Compliance
This standard shall take effect upon publication. Compliance is expected with all enterprise policies and standards.  Policies and standards may be amended at any time.
If compliance with this standard is not feasible or technically possible, or if deviation from this policy is necessary to support a business function, entities shall request an exception through the Chief Information Security Officer’s exception process.

FILE: Secure-Configuration-Standard.docx
================================================================================
1.0 Purpose and Benefits
The purpose of this standard is to establish baseline configurations for information systems that are owned and/or operated by the entity. Effective implementation of this standard will maximize security and minimize the potential risk of unauthorized access to information and technology.
2.0 Authority
[Authority Needed]
3.0 Scope
This standard applies to all information systems owned and/or operated by, or operated on behalf of the entity. Lab systems, such as those used for digital forensics or research, may require special consideration, however, this standard must be applied unless doing so inhibits the core functions of these systems or is otherwise not technically feasible.
4.0 Information Statement
Standard secure configuration profiles, based on any one or more of the industry consensus guidelines listed below, must be used in addition to the latest vendor security guidance. Alterations to the profile must be based on business need, policy or standard compliance, developed in consultation with the Information Security Officer/designated security representative, documented and retained for audit purposes.
Industry Consensus Guidelines
Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks
National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) National Checklist Program
United States Government Configuration Baselines (USGCB)
The initial setup, software installation, and security configuration of new systems must be performed in a secure environment isolated from other operational systems with minimal communication protocols enabled.
Changes to configurations are formally identified, proposed, reviewed, analyzed for security impact, tested, and approved prior to implementation in accordance with the change management procedures. Individuals conducting security impact analyses possess the necessary skills and technical expertise to analyze the changes to information systems and the associated security ramifications.
Entities must maintain configuration management plans that define detailed processes and procedures for how configuration management is used to support secure system development life cycle activities at the information system level. Configuration management plans are typically developed during the development/acquisition phase of the secure system development life cycle.
A configuration monitoring process must be in place to identify undiscovered or undocumented system components, misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and unauthorized changes.
5.0 Compliance
This standard shall take effect upon publication. Compliance is expected with all enterprise policies and standards.  Policies and standards may be amended at any time.
If compliance with this standard is not feasible or technically possible, or if deviation from this policy is necessary to support a business function, entities shall request an exception through the Chief Information Security Officer’s exception process.

FILE: Secure-System-Development-Life-Cycle-Standard.docx
================================================================================
1.0 Purpose and Benefits
While considered a separate process by many, information security is a business requirement to be considered throughout the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  This Secure System Development Life Cycle Standard defines security requirements that must be considered and addressed within every SDLC.
Computer systems and applications are created to address business needs. To do so effectively, system requirements must be identified early and addressed as part of the SDLC. Failure to identify a requirement until late in the process can have major repercussions to the success of a project and result in project delivery delays, deployment of an inadequate system, and even the abandonment of the project. Furthermore, for each phase through which a project passes without identifying and addressing a requirement, the more costly and time-consuming it is to fix problems that occur because of the omission.
Information security must be adequately considered and built into every phase of the SDLC.  Failure to identify risks and implement proper controls can result in inadequate security, potentially putting entities at risk of data breaches, reputational exposure, loss of public trust, compromise to systems/networks, financial penalties and legal liability.
2.0 Authority
[Authority Needed]
3.0 Scope
[Scope Needed]
4.0 Information Statement
Security is a requirement that must be included within every phase of a system development life cycle.  A system development life cycle that includes formally defined security activities within its phases is known as a secure SDLC. Per the Information Security Policy, a secure SDLC must be utilized in the development of all applications and systems.
At a minimum, an SDLC must contain the following security activities. These activities must be documented or referenced within an associated information security plan. Documentation must be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate the extent to which each security activity is applied. The documentation must be retained for auditing purposes.
Define Security Roles and Responsibilities
Orient Staff to the SDLC Security Tasks
Establish a System Criticality Level
Classify Information
Establish System Identity Credential Requirements
Establish System Security Profile Objectives
Create a System Profile
Decompose the System
Assess Vulnerabilities and Threats
Assess Risks
Select and Document Security Controls
Create Test Data
Test Security Controls
Perform Certification and Accreditation
Manage and Control Change
Measure Security Compliance
Perform System Disposal
There is not necessarily a one-to-one correspondence between security activities and SDLC phases. Security activities often need to be performed iteratively as a project progresses or cycles through the SDLC. Unless stated otherwise, the placement of security activities within the SDLC may vary in accordance with the SDLC being utilized and the security needs of the application or system. Appendix A:  Security Activities within the SDLC provides a sample correlation of security activities to a generic system development life cycle. Appendix B:  Description of Security Activities provides a description of the above security considerations and activities.
Finally, it is important to note that the Secure SDLC process is comprehensive by intention, to assure due-diligence, compliance, and proper documentation of security-related controls and considerations. Designing security into systems requires an investment of time and resources. The extent to which security is applied to the SDLC process should be commensurate with the classification (data sensitivity and system criticality) of the system being developed and risks this system may introduce into the overall environment.  This assures value to the development process and deliverable.  Generally speaking, the best return on investment is achieved by rigorously applying security within the SDLC process to high risk/high cost projects. Where it is determined that a project will not leverage the full Secure SDLC  process – for example, on a lower-risk/cost project, the rationale must be documented, and the security activities that are not used must be identified and approved as part of the formal risk acceptance process.
Note: Data classification cannot be used as the sole determinate of whether or not the project is low risk/cost.  For example, public facing websites cannot be considered low risk/cost projects even if all the data is public.  There is a risk of compromise of the website to inject malware and compromise visitor’s machines or to change the content of the website to create embarrassment.
5.0 Compliance

The table below shows the placement of security activities within the phases of a sample SDLC. The actual placement of security activities within the system development life cycle may vary in accordance with the actual SDLC being utilized in a project and the particular security needs of the application or system.  The NIST publications in the third column of this table are recommended documents to provide guidance in the placement and execution of security tasks within the system development life cycle. These documents are available from the NIST website (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html).
Figure A-1: Placement of Security Activities within SDLC Phases
Define Security Roles and Responsibilities
Security roles must be defined and each security activity within the SDLC must be clearly assigned to one or more security roles. These roles must be documented and include the persons responsible for the security activities assigned to each role. Appendix C:  Security Roles within the SDLC provides guidelines for defining security roles and assigning security activities to roles.
Orient Staff to the SDLC Security Tasks
All parties involved in the execution of a project’s SDLC security activities must understand the purpose, objectives and deliverables of each security activity in which they are involved or for which they are responsible.
Establish System Criticality Level
When initiating an application or system, the criticality of the system must be established. The criticality level must reflect the business value of the function provided by the system and the potential business damage that might result from a loss of access to this functionality.
Classify Information
As per the Information Security Policy, all information contained within, manipulated by or passing through a system or application must be classified. Classification must reflect the importance of the information’s confidentiality, integrity and availability.
Establish System Identity Credential Requirements
All applications or systems which require authentication must establish a user identity credential. The identity credential must reflect the required confidence level that the person seeking to access the system is who they claim to and the potential impact to the security and integrity of the system if the person is not who they claim to be.
Establish System Security Profile Objectives
When initiating an application or system, the security profile objectives must be identified and documented. These objectives must state the importance and relevance of identified security concepts (Appendix D: Security Concepts) to the system and indicate the extent and rigor with which each security concept is to be built in or reflected in the system and software. Each security concept must be considered throughout each life cycle phase and any special considerations or needs documented.
The purpose behind establishing system security profiles and monitoring them throughout the lifecycle is to be actively aware of the relative priority, weight and relevance of each security concept at each phase of the system’s life cycle. Entities must verify that the security profile objectives adequately consider all federal, state and external security mandates for which the system must be compliant.
Profile the System
The system or application being developed must be iteratively profiled by technical teams within the SDLC. A system profile is a high-level overview of the application that identifies the application’s attributes such as the physical topology, the logical tiers, components, services, actors, technologies, external dependencies and access rights. This profile must be updated throughout the various phases of the SDLC.
Decompose the System
The system or application must be decomposed into finer components and its mechanics (i.e. the inner workings) must be documented. This activity is to be iteratively performed within the SDLC.  Decomposition includes identifying trust boundaries, information entry and exit points, data flows and privileged code.
Assess Vulnerabilities and Threats
Vulnerability assessments must be iteratively performed within the SDLC process. Threat assessments must consider not only technical threats, but also administrative and physical threats that could have a potential negative impact on the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the system. Threat assessments must consider and document the threat sources, threat source motivations and attack methods that could potentially pose threats to the security of the system.
Threat assessments must adhere to all relevant state and federal mandates to which the entity must comply and follow industry best practices including the documentation of the assessment processes. Threat assessments and the underlying threat modeling deliverables that support the assessment must also be fully documented. Appendix E: Threat and Risk Assessment Resources includes a list of recommended resources for performing threat assessments.
Assess Risk
Risk assessments must be iteratively performed within the SDLC process.  These begin as an informal, high-level process early in the SDLC and become a formal, comprehensive process prior to placing a system or software into production.
All realistic threats and vulnerabilities identified in the threat assessments must be addressed in the risk assessments. The risk assessments must be based on the value of the information in the system, the classification of the information, the value of the business function provided by the system, the potential threats to the system, the likelihood of occurrence, the impact of the failure of the system and the consequences of the failure of security controls.
All identified risks are to be appropriately managed by avoiding, transferring, accepting or mitigating the risk. Ignoring risk is prohibited. Risk assessments must adhere to all relevant state and federal mandates that the entity must document and be compliant.
The risk assessments must be periodically reviewed and updated as necessary whenever the underlying threat assessment is modified or whenever significant changes are made to the system. Appendix E: Threat and Risk Assessment Resources includes a list of recommended resources for performing risk assessments.
Select and Document Security Controls
Appropriate security controls must be implemented to mitigate risks that are not avoided, transferred or accepted. Security controls must be justified and documented based on the risk assessments, threat assessments and analysis of the cost of implementing a potential security control relative to the decrease in risk afforded by implementing the control.
Documentation of controls must be sufficiently detailed to enable verification that all systems and applications adhere to all relevant security policies and to respond efficiently to new threats that may require modifications to existing controls.
Residual risk must be documented and maintained at acceptable levels. A formal risk acceptance, with executive management sign-off, must be performed for medium and high risks that remain after mitigating controls have been implemented.
Security control requirements must be periodically reviewed and updated as necessary whenever the system or the underlying risk assessment is modified.
Create Test Data
A process for the development of significant test data must be created for all applications. A test process must be available for applications to perform security and regression testing.
Confidential production data should not be used for testing purposes. If production data is used, entities must comply with all applicable federal, state and external policies and standards regarding the protection and disposal of production data.
Test Security Controls
All controls are to be thoroughly tested in pre-production environments that are identical, in as much as feasibly possible, to the corresponding production environment. This includes the hardware, software, system configurations, controls and any other customizations.
The testing process, including regression testing, must demonstrate that all security controls have been applied appropriately, implemented correctly and are functioning properly and actually countering the threats and vulnerabilities for which they are intended. The testing process must also include vulnerability testing and demonstrate the remediation of critical vulnerabilities prior to placing the system into production.
Appropriate separation of duties must be observed throughout the testing processes such as ensuring that different individuals are responsible for development, quality assurance and accreditation.
Perform Accreditation
The system security plan must be analyzed, updated, and accepted by executive management.
Manage and Control Change
A formal change management process must be followed whenever a system or application is modified in order to avoid direct or indirect negative impacts that the change might impose. The change management process must ensure that all SDLC security activities are considered and performed, if relevant, and that all SDLC security controls and documentation that are impacted by the change are updated.
Measure Security Compliance
All applications and systems are required to undergo periodic security compliance assessments to ensure they reflect a security posture commensurate with the definition of acceptable risk. Security compliance assessments must include assessments for compliance with all federal, state and external compliance standards for which the entity is required to comply.
Security compliance assessments must be performed after all system and application changes and periodically as part of continuous system compliance monitoring.
Perform System Disposal
The information contained in applications and systems must be protected once a system has reached end of life. Information must be retained according to applicable federal and state mandates or other retention requirements. Information without retention requirements must be discarded or destroyed and all disposed media must be sanitized in accordance with applicable federal and state standards to remove residual information.
Responsibility for each security activity within the SDLC must be assigned to one or more security roles. To accomplish this, the default definition of an SDLC role may be expanded to include security responsibilities and/or new security roles may be defined to encompass security activities. In all cases, the assignment of security activities to roles, and the identification of persons given responsibility for these roles, must be clearly documented.
For the purpose of utilizing a consistent definition of roles across various SDLC’s, it is highly recommended that entities utilize as guidelines the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publications . Of specific relevance to the definition of roles and SDLC frameworks are:
NIST Special Publication 800-37 Rev. 2 Risk Management Framework for Informtion Systems and Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy
The makeup of a system and software from a security perspective is its security profile and includes the following security concepts, which must be considered and documented as part of a Secure SDLC process.
Figure D-1: Security Concepts
Information concerning these concepts is publically available at the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Cyber Security and Communications sponsored website at https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov.
In order to assure alignment with business compliance mandates, and help assure efficient and effective delivery of security services, the use of industry-recognized standards related to risk-based frameworks and secure system development life cycle practices are recommended.
In particular, the use of NIST standards is highly recommended, especially for entities required to comply with federal security mandates. The following NIST publications provide recommended guidance for implementing risk management frameworks and performing threat and risk assessments.

FILE: Security-Logging-Standard.docx
================================================================================
1.0 Purpose and Benefits
Logs record data so that systems and networks can be appropriately monitored to maintain use for authorized purposes and an awareness of the operating environment, including detecting indications of security problems.
This standard defines requirements for security log generation, management, storage, disposal, access, and use. Security logs are generated by many sources, including security software, such as antivirus software, firewalls, and intrusion detection and prevention systems; operating systems on servers, workstations, and networking equipment; databases and applications.
2.0 Authority
[Authority Needed]
3.0 Scope
[Scope Needed]
4.0 Information Statement
Logs must be generated in information technology (IT) systems and networks.  Because of the nature of the data contained in security logs (e.g., passwords, e-mail content), they are considered personally identifying information (PII) and must be protected with the controls for a confidentiality and integrity of high.
Initial Log Generation
All hosts and networking equipment must perform security log generation for all components (e.g., OS, service, application).
All security events (Appendix A) must be logged and must be set to capture significant levels of detail to indicate activity.
Log Administration
All hosts and networking equipment must issue alerts on security log processing failures, such as software/hardware errors, failures in the log capturing mechanisms, and log storage capacity being reached or exceeded.   All alerts must be as close to real time as possible.
When non-revolving log storage reaches 90% capacity, a warning must be issued.
Log Consolidation
Security-related information from all systems, with the exception of individual workstations, must be transferred to a consolidated log infrastructure. Systems running workstation operating systems which are used for shared services, such as shared file storage or web services must also satisfy these requirements.
All workstations must have the ability to transfer logs to a consolidated log infrastructure, if needed.
Log data must be transferred real-time from individual hosts to a consolidated log infrastructure. Where real-time transfer is not possible, data must be transferred from the individual hosts to a consolidated log infrastructure as quickly as the technology allows.
Entities must establish processes for the establishment, operation and, as appropriate, integration of log management systems.
Log Storage and Disposal
Within the consolidated log infrastructure, logs must be maintained and readily available for a minimum of 92 days. Based on entity requirements, including audit or legal needs, logs may need to be retained for a longer period of time.
Log data must be securely disposed of (at both the system and the infrastructure level) in compliance with the Sanitization/Secure Disposal Standard.
Systems that collect logs, whether local or consolidated, must maintain sufficient storage space to meet the minimum requirements for both readily available and retained logs. Storage planning must account for log bursts or increases in storage requirements that could reasonably be expected to result from system issues, including security.
A process must be put in place to provide for log preservation requests, such as a legal requirement to prevent the alteration and destruction of particular log records (e.g., how the impacted logs must be marked, stored, and protected).
Log integrity for consolidated log infrastructure needs to be preserved, such as storing logs on write-once media or generating message digests for each log file.
Log Access and Use
Log data must be initially analyzed as close to real time as possible.
Access to log management systems must be recorded and must be limited to individuals with a specific need for access to the records. Access to log data must be limited to the specific sets of data appropriate for the business need.
Procedures must exist for managing unusual events. Response must be commensurate with system criticality, data sensitivity and regulatory requirements.
5.0 Compliance
This standard shall take effect upon publication. Compliance is expected with all enterprise policies and standards.  Entities may amend its policies and standards at any time; compliance with amended policies and standards is expected.
If compliance with this standard is not feasible or technically possible, or if deviation from this policy is necessary to support a business function, entities shall request an exception through the Chief Information Security Officer’s exception process.

Security events that must be logged for all systems include but are not limited to:
Successful and unsuccessful authentication events to include but not limited to:
system logon/logoff;
account or user-ID;
change of password;
the type of event;
an indication of success or failure of event;
the date and time of event; and
Identification of the source of event such as location, IP addresses terminal ID or other means of identification.
Unsuccessful resource access events will be logged to include at minimum:
account or user-ID;
the type of event;
an indication of the event;
the date and time of event;
the resource; and
identification of the source of event such as location, IP addresses terminal ID or other means of identification.
Successful and unsuccessful privileged operations including but not limited to:
use of system privileged accounts;
system starts and stops;
hardware attachments and detachments;
system and network management alerts and errors messages; and
security events - account/group management and policy changes.
Successful and unsuccessful access to log files to include but not limited to:
account or user-ID;
the type of event;
an indication of success or failure of event;
the date and time of event; and
identification of the source of event such as location, IP address, terminal ID or other means of identification.
Most web servers offer the option to store log files in either the common log format or an extended log format. The extended log format records more information than the common log file format. When technically feasible web servers must use extended log format. The extended log format adds valuable logging information to your log file so you can determine where messages are coming from, who is sending the message and adds information to the log file that would be necessary to trace an attack.
For systems identified as critical based on a risk assessment or systems that have not yet been classified, in addition to the above, successful resource access events will be logged to include at a minimum:
account or user-ID;
the type of event;
an indication of the event;
the date and time of event;
the resource; and
identification of the source of event such as location, IP addresses terminal ID or other means of identification.

POLICY
_______________________________________________________________
This policy is applicable to all departments and users of resources and assets.
APPLICATION PARTITIONING
IT Department shall:
Separate user functionality from information system management functionality either logically or physically.
Information system management functionality includes, for example, functions necessary to administer databases, network components, workstations, or servers, and typically requires privileged user access.
INFORMATION IN SHARED RESOURCES
IT Department shall:
Prevent unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources.
This control prevents information, including encrypted representations of information, produced by the actions of prior users/roles from being available to any current users/roles (or current processes) that obtain access to shared system resources (e.g., registers, main memory, hard disks) after those resources have been released back to information systems.
DENIAL OF SERVICE PROTECTION
IT Department shall:
Ensure that the information system protects against or limit the effects of the following types of denial of service attacks: [entity defined types of denial of service attacks] by employing [entity defined security safeguards].
The information system restricts the ability of individuals to launch [entity defined denial of service attacks] against other information systems.
BOUNDARY PROTECTION
IT Department shall:
Monitor and control communications at the external boundary of the system and at key internal boundaries within the system.
Implement sub-networks for publicly accessible system components that are [physically; logically] separated from internal organizational networks, and connected to external networks or information systems only through managed interfaces consisting of boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with an organizational security architecture.
Managed interfaces include, for example, gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, network-based malicious code analysis and virtualization systems, or encrypted tunnels implemented within security architecture.
TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY
IT Department shall:
Deploy information systems that protect the [confidentiality; integrity] of transmitted information.
This control applies to both internal and external networks and all types of information system components from which information can be transmitted (e.g., servers, mobile devices, notebook computers, printers, copiers, scanners, facsimile machines).
NETWORK DISCONNECT
IT Department shall:
Ensure information systems are configured to terminate the network connection associated with a communications session at the end of the session or after [entity defined time period] of inactivity; this control applies to both internal and external networks.
Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions include, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level, or de-allocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single, operating system-level network connection.
CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY ESTABLISHMENT AND MANAGEMENT
IT Department shall:
Establish and manage cryptographic keys for required cryptography employed within the information system in accordance with [entity defined requirements for key generation, distribution, storage, access, and destruction].
CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION
IT Department shall:
Implement [entity defined cryptographic uses and type of cryptography required for each use] in accordance with applicable federal and state laws, directives, policies, regulations, and standards.
Cryptography can be employed to support a variety of security solutions including, for example, the protection of classified and Controlled Unclassified Information, the provision of digital signatures, and the enforcement of information separation when authorized individuals have the necessary clearances for such information but lack the necessary formal access approvals.
COLLABORATIVE COMPUTING DEVICES
IT Department shall:
Prohibit remote activation of collaborative computing devices with the following exceptions: [entity defined exceptions where remote activation is to be allowed].
Provide an explicit indication of use to users physically present at the devices.
Collaborative computing devices include, for example, networked white boards, cameras, and microphones. Explicit indication of use includes, for example, signals to users when collaborative computing devices are activated.
PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE CERTIFICATES
IT Department shall:
Issue public key certificates under a [defined certificate policy] or obtain public key certificates from an approved service provider.
Manage information system trust stores for all key certificates to ensure only approved trust anchors are in the trust stores.
MOBILE CODE
IT Department shall:
Define acceptable and unacceptable mobile code and mobile code technologies.
Establish usage restrictions and implementation guidance for acceptable mobile code and mobile code technologies.
Authorize, monitor, and control the use of mobile code within the information system.
Decisions regarding the employment of mobile code within organizational information systems are based on the potential for the code to cause damage to the systems if used maliciously.
VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL
IT Department shall:
Establish usage restrictions and implementation guidance for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies based on the potential to cause damage to the information system if used maliciously.
Authorize, monitor, and control the use of VoIP within the information system.
SECURE NAME / ADDRESS RESOLUTION SERVICE (AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE)
IT Department shall:
Provide additional data origin authentication and integrity verification artifacts along with the authoritative name resolution data the system returns in response to external name/address resolution queries.
Provide the means to indicate the security status of child zones and (if the child supports secure resolution services) to enable verification of a chain of trust among parent and child domains, when operating as part of a distributed, hierarchical namespace.
This control enables external clients including, for example, remote Internet clients, to obtain origin authentication and integrity verification assurances for the host/service name to network address resolution information obtained through the service.
SECURE NAME / ADDRESS RESOLUTION SERVICE (RECURSIVE OR CACHING RESOLVER)
IT Department shall:
Ensure information systems that requests and performs data origin authentication and data integrity verification on the name/address resolution responses the system receives from authoritative sources.
Each client of name resolution services either performs this validation on its own, or has authenticated channels to trusted validation providers. Information systems that provide name and address resolution services for local clients include, for example, recursive resolving or caching domain name system (DNS) servers.
ARCHITECTURE AND PROVISIONING FOR NAME / ADDRESS RESOLUTION SERVICE
IT Department shall:
Ensure the information systems that collectively provide name/address resolution service for an organization are fault-tolerant and implement internal/external role separation.
Employ at least two authoritative domain name system servers, one configured as the primary server and the other configured as the secondary server, to eliminate single points of failure and to enhance redundancy.
Information systems that provide name and address resolution services include, for example, domain name system (DNS) servers.
SESSION AUTHENTICITY
IT Department shall:
Ensure the information system protects the authenticity of communications sessions.
This control addresses communications protection at the session versus packet level (e.g., sessions in service-oriented architectures providing web-based services) and establishes grounds for confidence at both ends of communications sessions in ongoing identities of other parties and in the validity of information transmitted.
PROTECTION OF INFORMATION AT REST
IT Department shall:
Ensure the information system protects the [confidentiality; integrity] of [entity defined information at rest].
This control addresses the confidentiality and integrity of information at rest and covers user information and system information. Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is located on storage devices as specific components of information systems.
PROCESS ISOLATION
IT Department shall:
Ensure the information system maintains a separate execution domain for each executing process.
Information systems can maintain separate execution domains for each executing process by assigning each process a separate address space. Each information system process has a distinct address space so that communication between processes is performed in a manner controlled through the security functions, and one process cannot modify the executing code of another process.

FILE: Vulnerability-Scanning-Standard.docx
================================================================================
1.0 Purpose and Benefits
Entities utilize automated tools to scan systems, computing and network devices, web applications and application code. The results of these scans help inform management and system administrators of known and potential vulnerabilities.
Vulnerability management is a process by which the vulnerabilities identified through scanning are tracked, evaluated, prioritized and managed until the vulnerabilities are remediated or otherwise appropriately resolved. Managing the vulnerabilities identified during scans ensures that appropriate actions are taken to reduce the potential that these vulnerabilities are exploited and thereby reduce risk of compromise to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information assets.
2.0 Authority
[Authority Needed]
3.0 Scope
[Scope Needed]
4.0 Information Statement
As per the Information Security Policy, all systems must be scanned for vulnerabilities.  In addition, each system must be inventoried and have an individual or group assigned responsibility for maintenance and administration.
Types of Scans
The type of vulnerability scans appropriate for a given target depends on the target type (i.e., hardware, software, source code) and the target’s location (i.e., internal or external to the network). The table below lists the types of vulnerability scans required by this standard.
Scanning
Entities are responsible for confirming that vulnerability scans are conducted.  Entities must use a scanning tool approved by the ISO/designated security representative.  Any approved scanning tool must be able to provide remediation suggestions and be able to associate a severity value to each vulnerability discovered based on the relative impact of the vulnerability to the affected system.
As per the Information Classification Standard, scan reports are classified with moderate confidentiality and moderate integrity and should be protected as such.
Entities are required to provide all external IP addresses and Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) for all externally facing web applications to the ISO/designated security representatives.
Network and system administrators must provide sufficient access to allow the vulnerability scan engine to scan all services provided by the system.  No devices connected to the network shall be specifically configured to block vulnerability scans from authorized scanning engines.
Scans must be performed within the system development life cycle (see SSDLC Standard) while in pre-deployment environments, when deployed into the target implementation environment, and periodically thereafter as specified below:
Pre-deployment scans occur prior to the move of the system or web application to the target implementation environment:
All systems must undergo an authenticated internal infrastructure scan, where technically feasible or required, before being deployed to the target implementation environment.  Any infrastructure vulnerability discovered must be remediated or determined to be a false positive or insignificant risk, by the Information Security Officer (ISO)/designated security representative, prior to the system being deployed for intended use.
When source code is available, applications must undergo source code scanning before the updated code moves into the target implementation environment if there has been a change to application code.
Scans must be authenticated when the application requires authentication before being deployed into the target implementation environment or into an environment that is externally accessible. When authentication is required to access the application, scans must be run with authenticated access at each access level (e.g., user, admin) supported by the application, except where limitations in the tool prevent authenticated scanning.  Any web application vulnerability discovered must be remediated or determined to be a false positive or insignificant risk by the ISO/designated security representative, prior to the system being placed into the target implementation environment.
Any system or application deployed to its target implementation environment with un-remediated vulnerabilities must have a formal remediation plan and the documented approval of the executive responsible for risk management or their designee.
Implementation scans occur the first time a system or web application is moved to its target implementation environment:
Systems must be scanned immediately upon being placed into the target implementation environment with an authenticated internal infrastructure scan, where technically feasible or required. If the system is accessible from the internet or an external network, then the system must be scanned with an external infrastructure scan.
Web applications must be scanned within the first month of being placed into the target implementation environment. An authenticated in-depth web application scan is required if feasible, but at minimum a “lite” web application scan is required. Sensitivity and criticality of the application must be considered when determining the schedule for the initial implementation scan.
Recurring Scans: After the initial scan in the target implementation environment, the frequency of scans are to occur according to the system or application’s risk rating (see Table 2).
When performing internal infrastructure scans on systems built using a shared image, such as workstations, scans may be run on a sampling of systems but the sample set must vary from scan to scan.
Web applications in production are required to undergo recurring scans. At minimum, web applications in production are required to undergo recurring “lite” application scans.
All vulnerabilities found during scans must be addressed as per the remediation section below.
Determine Risk Rating and Frequency of Scans
The risk that vulnerabilities pose to systems and applications is based on the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited and the impact if the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the information assets were compromised. The likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited is increased in direct relation to the system’s or application’s accessibility from other systems.
The impact to the information assets is based on the asset’s information classification (see Information Classification Standard).  Impact (i.e., high, moderate or low) if the confidentiality, integrity or availability is compromised must be considered and the highest individual impact rating for confidentiality, integrity or availability utilized within the table below.
Minimum frequency of scans is dependent on the risk rating. Systems without a risk rating must be scanned as if they had a risk rating of “High” until they are rated.
Remediation
Vulnerabilities discovered during scans must be remediated based on risk rating (see Table 2) and vulnerability severity identified by the scanning tool as per the table below.
The ISO/designated security representative may review vulnerabilities to adjust the severity rating if necessary.  Testing must be done to verify that remediation has been completed.
Individuals managing vulnerability scans are required to notify the ISO/designated security representative within 1 business day of scan completion for new vulnerabilities and at least monthly of un-remediated vulnerabilities on systems or applications that are running in production.
ISOs/designated security representatives must notify management of any un-remediated vulnerabilities not addressed in the timeframes prescribed in this standard, so that risk is accepted by the appropriate party.
5.0 Compliance
This standard shall take effect upon publication. Compliance is expected with all enterprise policies and standards.  Policies and standards may be amended at any time; compliance with amended policies and standards is expected.
If compliance with this standard is not feasible or technically possible, or if deviation from this policy is necessary to support a business function, Entities shall request an exception through the Chief Information Security Officer’s exception process.
